CROW: Exhibit R: Stephen Ratliff wore one of those Tor Johnson
      masks for Halloween in 1983!
MIKE: That's enough, Crow.

TOM: Your author is away from home.  Please leave a message.

>        Away From Home's first section (the Field Trip) having been

> For those of you trying to keep up with my story's time frame,

CROW: ...I would recommend a severe beating.

> The Field
> Trip occurs at the end of season 5.  The Away Mission occurs before
> Generations, and after All Good Things and my story Who Q? Where Q?

TOM: So it's a few years later, then.
MIKE: Any bets on whether Marissa's first period is over yet?

>        Note to the archivist : The Parts of The Away Mission will be
> labeled starting with 11.  An interlude will be part 8 and parts 9 and
> 10 do not exist.

CROW: It's Ratliff's version of the 18 minute gap.

CROW: Four voodoo dolls and a blank? I think that pays 20 to 1.

TOM: *sigh* Here we go again.  <to others> Good luck, guys.

>       Commander William T. Riker was on his way to Engineering when
> Marrissa caught up to him and called out, "Commander Riker."

MIKE: But he wasn't sure who she was addressing.

>       "Yes, Lieutenant," Riker said as Marrissa pulled along side.

CROW: Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon?

>       "I've been meaning to ask you why I haven't been on one of your
> away teams yet," She asked.  "According to the Computer I am the only
> one who hasn't."

TOM: Maybe because you're 12 and not a real officer?

>       "I never thought I would be this close to 100% away team
> parceapation," Riker commented.  

MIKE: <Riker> I've got to start excluding more crewmembers.

> "Refresh my memory, what are your qualifications, Lieutenant."

CROW: <Marrissa> For one, I can spell "participation"...

>       "I'm seventh in the phaser accuracy ratings," Marrissa replied.

TOM: Out of 1400 of the "best" officers in Starfleet.  Right.

> "Commander Data list me as a specialist in Trakce and Feudal culture.

MIKE: ...but not grammar.
CROW: That's nice, but we're in Vulcan space right now.

> You are the only pilot on board with higher ratings."

TOM: No wonder they keep losing shuttlecraft.

>       "I will keep you in mind," Riker said.  

MIKE: <Riker> ...but I won't select you.

> "Why did you come to me?
> Surely your father could have asked me to take you on a mission."

CROW: <Marrissa> He could have, but he's dead, DEAD, *DEAD*!!!

>       "Two reasons, one I prefer to avoid having my father intervening
> on my behalf," Marrissa stated. 

TOM: <Marrissa> ...except when I don't get my way.

> "And two it looks better on my record if 
> if I ask for more and different duties."

MIKE: Bet it doesn't look so good when she gets turned down.

>       "Be careful you don't take on too much," Riker said.  "You can
> only do so much."

CROW: You can only save one universe at a time, sweetie.

>       "I'm not stupid," Marrissa said.  

TOM: <Marissa> I'm mental, not stupid.

> "I carefully check my schedule
> before asking for any duty.  It keeps Counselor Troi off my tail."

ALL: <clear throats>

>       "Good idea," Riker replied.  

MIKE: <Riker> I wish Counselor Troi was on *my* tail...

> "By the way who are the people
> above you in the phaser ratings and how did you get up their so fast?"

CROW: By using the phaser.
TOM: <evil Marrissa voice> Now you die and we *all* move up in rank!

>       "Data is number one followed by, Guinan, 

ALL: Guinan?!
MIKE: So *that's* why there are never any brawls in Ten Forward.

> Worf, yourself, my father, Doctor Crusher 

ALL: DR. CRUSHER?!
TOM: I'm quickly losing my faith in the competence of this crew.
CROW: You had faith?!

> and myself," Marrissa informed.
>       "I didn't realize that the Doctor was so high in the rankings,"
> Riker commented.

MIKE: <Riker> For some reason, that turns me on.

>       "The Doctor and I have been working on improving our phaser
> rankings," Marrissa said.

TOM: I stole some stuff from Sickbay and she's been hunting me down 
     ever since.

>       "So that's your self-improvement project of the month," Riker
> remarked.

CROW: <bored> Uh huh... uh huh... <quiet> oh please, God, get her away 
      from me!

>       "Last months, this months is putting up with insulting ensigns,"
> Marrissa said.
>       "Why?"

MIKE: <Riker> Why not just punch their lights out?

>       "They keep calling me Risa," Marrissa said with an under-tone of
> frustration.  "Their are only two people alive who can call me that."

TOM: And they're both dead.

>       "Is their a name you liked that people use to call you?" Riker
> inquired.

CROW: Yes, I like "Your Holiness".

>       "My natural father use to call me Princess," Marrissa mused.

MIKE: And he called himself King Ludwig.

> "Mom use to think it was funny for some reason."

TOM: But Mom was never the same after the accident.

>       "Interesting, by the way who are the people who can get away
> with calling you Risa," Riker asked.
>       "The Captain and Jay," Marrissa replied.

MIKE: Weren't they an old band from the 70s?

>       "Jay? Why him?"

CROW: He has certain... pictures.

>       "I am not going to answer that."
>       "I could order you to."
>       "You wouldn't DARE."

TOM: ...to stay off drugs.
MIKE: <Marrissa, menacingly> You know what happens to people who get 
      in my way!

>       Then the red alert lights went on and the Computer announced,
> "RED ALERT, RED ALERT, Commander Riker, report to the Bridge, Lieutenant
> Picard, report to the Bridge, RED ALERT."

CROW: Everyone else have a capuccino.  They can handle it.

> 
>       Captain Picard was in command, Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical and
> some Ensign at CONN 

TOM: Ensign Throwaway, perhaps?

>                     when Marrissa and Commander Riker arrived on the
> bridge.  "Marrissa get a PADD from my Ready Room," Captain Picard said.

MIKE: Make it "Imzadi."  I didn't like "The Siege."

> "We have need of your Trakce expeirance."
>       As Marrissa entered the Ready Room, Riker said, "Trakce? We 
> haven't heard from them in years."

TOM: Yeah, but the foreshadowing was pretty thick.

>       As soon as Marrissa returned to the bridge Captain Picard said,
> "We are on our way to the planet Dublin. We have received a distress 
> call from them.  Mr Worf, replay the message."
>       "Aye, sir"

MIKE: That's a pretty inocuous message.

>       The image of stars rushing by was replaced by a youthful
> colonial administrator.  He began, " This is the planet Dublin,  We are
> under attack by an unknown ship." (brief picture of yellow Trakce ship.)

CROW: <administrator> See?
TOM: It's a Vogon ship!  Note how it hangs in the air in the same way 
     that bricks don't.

> "It has overwhelmed our defenses and landed on the planet.  They are
> kidnapping our children.  

MIKE: <administrator> And if word gets out that an undocumented alien is
      watching my kids, I'll never be re-elected!

> Please re...." The message became static.

TOM: Re...turn your library books?  
CROW: Re...hash old plots?
MIKE: Re...write this fanfic?

>       "We will arrive in 5 minutes," Captain Picard said.  "Marrissa,
> why would they be taking children."
>       "Either One, obtaining slaves, Two looking for a puppet ruler,"
> Marrissa said.  

TOM: *snicker* Um, yeah, that makes sense.

> "The last ins unlikely 

CROW: <Marrissa> ...since I just made it up.

>                        but we shouldn't discount the possibility."

MIKE: Maybe they're simply taking hostages?

>       "Thank you Marrissa, take Conn," Captain Picard said.

TOM: <Ensign> But sir...
CROW: <Picard> Get out of that chair, damn you!  My little princess 
      will fly the ship!

>       "Captain, since they are on the planet, multiple away teams with
> our best phaser accuracy people are in order," Commander Riker suggested.

MIKE: Yeah, forget diplomacy in a hostage situation.  Just open fire.
TOM: And how *convenient* that Marrissa just raised her phaser ranking.

>       "Agreed, Three teams lead by yourself, Data, and Worf," They
> quickly moved to the turbolift. Captain Picard opened his mouth to
> object to Marrissa's inclusion on the team.  

MIKE: Umm... what inclusion?
CROW: This plot point left as an exercise for the reader.

> However a quick glare from Marrissa silenced him.  

TOM: I wonder if she's related to Charlie X.

> It was not wise to oppose Marrissa's career ambitions.

CROW: <Marrissa> I will dominate you all!  Even you, Daddy!
TOM: <hums "Shades of Shadow">

> 
>       Commander Riker's away team was forming up in Transporter Room
> One.  "Remember our objective is to rescue the children," Riker said.

MIKE: <Riker> Oh yeah, and to shoot stuff.

> "If I am unavailable, Lieutenant Picard is in command due to her
> expeirance with this race.  

TOM: And her complete lack of experience with away missions.

> Ensigns Lochard, Henderson, and Diral, you are our back up.

ALL: grumble grumble bitch grumble grumble captain's daughter grumble...

>       Commander Riker, Marrissa and four yellow shirts took position
> on the transporter platform, phasers drawn.  

CROW: The laundry's back, and it's ready to kick ass!

> "Entergize," Riker ordered.

MIKE: No, no, that was Ratliff's *first* story.

> 
>       The Away team beamed down in a low walled garden.  The Yellow
> Trakce ship was just about 50 yards away on the other side.  Suddenly
> purple energy bolts shot out from behind the low wall surrounding the
> Trakce ship.  

CROW: <sobbing> But it says up there that the wall is surrounding 
      the *away team*, not the ship, and, and--
MIKE: <hugs Crow> Shhh, it's all right, Crow.

> The Starfleet officers dove for cover behind the blue gray stone wall.

TOM: Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to beam directly in front of their
     phasers.

>

>       The Away Team was pinned down behind the low garden wall.  

CROW: Last time, on "Away From Home."
TOM: Just their luck: they try to hide behind it and it falls on them.

> "Damn Commander Riker said after missing a shot badly.

MIKE: <Riker> How could I have missed Marrissa at this range?

>       "Watch your language, Commander," Marrissa said, taking a quick
> and surprisingly accurate shot at the Trakce, stunning one.  "You

CROW: <Riker> Oh, shut the f--k up.

>       "I'll try to remember that," Riker said, taking an even less
> successful shot.

MIKE: <Riker> Jeez, has she got a personal force field or something?

>       "May I make a suggestion?" Marrissa asked.

TOM: <Marrissa> That phaser points the other way, numbnuts.

>       "Go Ahead," Riker said, looking at Marrissa.
>       "We have a fifteen meter long wall and we are only using about a

CROW: Oh, you mean like this: " .  .  . "?

> At that moment
> she was interrupted and enveloped in a swirling purple transporter beam.
>       "Damn," Riker cursed as Marrissa disappeared.  

MIKE: <Riker> Hey, no fair!  I called dibs!

> "Spread out, move after each shot.

TOM: This way, we'll be more like ducks in a shooting gallery!

CROW: She's in the White House?

MIKE: ...while the Trakce, once again, did absolutely nothing.
TOM: <Marrissa> Three more!  I'll have the Jonestown Life Achievement 
     Award in no time!

>       "Who are you?" 

CROW: <raspy voice> I'm Batman. 

>                      a young red-headed girl of about ten years of age

TOM: Sadly, Marrissa mistook her hair for a ribbon and shot her.

>       "Lieutenant Marrissa Picard or the Federation Starship
> Enterprise," Marrissa said.  

MIKE: I'm not sure which.  I don't think I'm a starship, though.

> "Who are you?"

CROW: <raspy voice> I'm your worst nightmare.
MIKE: Okay, that's enough.

>       "Heather O'Brien," the little girl said.  "You can't be a
> Lieutenant.  You're too young."

TOM: Well, you can't be an O'Brien.  You aren't Irish-Japanese enough.

MIKE: Oh, she's a Republican.

> Hum-um, this is surprisingly simple.  

CROW: Alien consoles in an unknown language?  No problem!

> Heather would you take a message to the Enterprise for me?"
>       "Sure, but how am I going to get there?" Heather asked.

TOM: <Heather> 'Cause we're in a transporter room and all and I don't 
     see any way...

>       "If you and your friends get on the transporter pad I'll arrange
> a tour of the Federation Flagship," Marrissa replied.

MIKE: <Heather> Big deal, I wanna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota!

>       "What's the message?" Heather inquired, mounting the platform.

CROW: "Prepare to be destroyed."

>       "Ross, beam down were you came from. 

TOM: Huh?  Who's Ross?
CROW: If that's Ross from "Catching Trouble," I *will* see him die here.

> Marrissa is taking on the enemy, which follows," Marrissa said.  

MIKE: The enemy is following Marrissa?

> "Now repeat it back."

TOM: <Heather> "Marrissa wants to die in a blaze of glory."

>       "Ross beam down where we came from.  Marrissa is taking on the

CROW: Now say it with feeling.

>       "Good, entergizing," Marrissa said.   The children disappeared
> "Now I wait."

MIKE: I wonder how many *days* it'll take for the Trakce to notice that 
      three of their crew are dead.

>

TOM: Fortunately, the children died quickly and painlessly.

CROW: Smoking or non-smoking?

>       "I have a message from the Lieutenant," Heather announced.
>       "Yes?"
>       "Ross beam down where we came from.  Marrissa is taking on the

MIKE: <Ross> What the hell does *that* mean?

>       "Transporter Room One to the Bridge," Ross Lochard said.
>       "This is Captain Picard."

TOM: <Picard> I *am* the Bridge!

>       "Marrissa just beamed some children on board," Ross informed the
> Captain.  

CROW: We eat well tonight!

> "They say that she wants reinforcements and that she is sending

MIKE: I'm sure Troi isn't doing anything important.

>       "Beam down, I'll make sure everything up here is taken care of.

TOM: I give up.  I've got no idea where anyone is or where they're going.

>       "Beam us down," Ross said as he joined Henderson and Diral on

CROW: No fair, yours is a Bernoulli.

MIKE: They would really spruce up the place.

>       They quickly got to work placing the Trakce on the plat form and

TOM: Hey, this isn't a shower, it's AAAAUUGH...

> Below it on the wall was a set of buttons.  The first was labeled

CROW: So they're in the red-light district?

> The second was a red line above a red button.  

MIKE: It says, "Push here for 1, 2, 3, or 9".

> The third a red line with a green circle below.  

TOM: Ah, the international symbol for "bad fanfic."

> The fourth button was a red box with two green circles in it.  

CROW: Beware of cheesy matte effects?

> Below all for buttons was a green bar with a green light in it.  
> Marrissa took out here tricorder and scanned the wall.

TOM: <Marrissa> Looks like Brady Bunch wallpaper.
MIKE: Next, she scanned a sandwich.

>       Meanwhile Ensign Lochard was examining the panel by the door.  he

CROW: Lochard's not exactly long on brains, I guess.

> "Lieutenant I thing I have figured out how to open the door," he said.

MIKE: <Lochard> There's a doorknob!
TOM: These people have been spoiled by doors you just walk at.

>       "Take up positions," Marrissa ordered.  

CROW: Assume the position!

> Marrissa and Ensign
> Lochard took one side and Ensigns Henderson and Diral the other. "Now."

MIKE: They broke into a spontaneous dance number.

TOM: <Marrissa> Ross, remove your hand or I tell my dad!

MIKE: Wow, all that because Ross touched Marrissa's hinder.

>       The panel went blank a did the transporter console.  "Great,

CROW: <Marrissa> I'm being sarcastic.  Can't you *tell*?

> "Lieutenant Picard to Enterprise." A nasty

TOM: If you're in that much trouble, might I suggest, oh, BEAMING OUT?!

> Then
> Marrissa noticed that her panel was still lit.  Proceeding across the

MIKE: Well, aliens are only as smart as their creators.

>       "Stupid?" Ross inquired.

CROW: <Marrissa> What did you call me?

>       "I think this panel is intruder control," Marrissa said.  "It's

TOM: But since they're stupid, who knows.

>       "Then lets do it." Ross said.  

MIKE: As soon as we figure out what the hell you're talking about.

>       "Not so fast Ensign," Marrissa said.  "I think the first one is

CROW: <Marrissa> Or it could be the ship's self-destruct sequencer.  I'm 
      not sure.

>       "May I suggest the fourth?" Ensign Lochard said.
>       "Agreed, we need to disable as many as we can," Marrissa said,
> pressing the fourth button.  An red outline appeared around the button,
> and the green light inside the green bar turned red.  An heavy object
> hit the door.

TOM: So the ship's intruder controls are all in the transporter room?  The 
     place most likely to have intruders??
CROW: <giggling> Aren't plot conveniences great?
MIKE: Judging by those last two sentences I'm willing to bet Ratliff has an 
      entire editing cycle completely devoted to adding adjectives.

>       "Apparently it worked," Ross observed as the red outline

TOM: Since the battering ram just hit the door and everything.

>       "Now to see if I can clear it up," Marrissa said.  She pressed

CROW: Hey, when I said they had croquet balls for brains, I didn't know!

TOM: <Elmer Fudd> I killed the wabbit...

MIKE: After kill #374, Marrissa finally begins to show remorse.

CROW: Stop feeling guilty, it's just a dumb old alien.

>       Marrissa shook her head to clear her mind and got up.  

TOM: <Marrissa> Well, let's get rid of all that nasty guilt.  There!  I'm 
     all better!

> "What was that Ross?"

CROW: <Ross Hagen> Chili peppers burn my gut!

MIKE: Sounds like they're ripe for a peasant revolt.

TOM: So this Trakce invasion consists of, like, 6 aliens?

>       "Then lets get to those remaining Trakce," Marrissa replied.

CROW: <Marrissa> I find I like killing.

MIKE: <Marrissa> Keep Ross away from me, Henderson.

>       "Yes Lieutenant," Ross responded.

TOM: <Ross, bitter> Don't remind me, SIR...

CROW: Or don't call me at all.

MIKE: Jeez, you don't have to be so snotty about it.

TOM: Then he should be able to figure it out much quicker.
CROW: <Ross> It's marked "3000 VOLTS - DO NOT TOUCH."  Should I touch it?

MIKE: You're in no danger, you have real names.

CROW: <Ross> But, uh, I have to press a button.
TOM: Speaking of which, let's get out of here.

[They leave the theater.]

1...2...3...4...5...6...*...

[SoL. Gypsy is alone on the bridge. An alarm starts beeping.]

GYPSY: Huh? Unidentified object at close range... Cambot, give me
       Rocket #9!

[Switch to Rocket #9. A teddy bear is floating all alone in the night.
It's wearing a read and blue baseball cap and some sort of baseball
shirt. As it tumbles towards the camera, one can make out "J. S." on
the front of the shirt and "BABEARLON 5" on the back.]

[SoL]

GYPSY: Aww... poor little guy! Hang on, I'm coming out!

[Rocket #9. The bear hits the camera with an audible <whump>, then gets
pulled away to the side.]

[SoL. Gypsy isn't there; Mike and Tom wander in.]

TOM: ...it was just a fluke, I tell you. The Flyers are going all the
     way this year, no ifs, ands, or buts!

[Gypsy comes in and drops the bear on the counter.]

MIKE: Gypsy, what's this?
GYPSY: It was floating by and hit Rocket #9.
TOM: <as Mike picks up the bear> Geez, Gypsy, do you have bring in every
     piece of space junk that floats by us?
MIKE: Yeah!... He's kind of a cute li'l guy, though. <He and Tom start
     playing with the bear>

[Crow comes in, carrying a pile of papers.]

CROW: Okay, Tom, I will *prove* to you that the Rangers can [sees bear]
      OH MY GOD!!
MIKE: What is it, Crow?
CROW: <panicked> Mike, where did that thing come from???
MIKE: Gypsy brought him in. <to Tom and Gypsy> What do you think we should
      call him?
GYPSY: Um...
TOM: How about Alvin?
CROW: We've got to get rid of it!
TOM: Why, Crow?
CROW: There must be a crossover field nearby! If we don't get that bear
      off the ship, anything could happen!

[Mike and Tom look reluctant. Gypsy seems to be lost in a world of her
own.]

CROW: Besides, it could be carrying some mutant space virus or something.
MIKE: Yaaah! 

[Mike runs off-screen; sounds of machinery are heard]

MIKE: <returning> Phew! That was a close one.

[The teddy bear floats past the SoL's window]

TOM: Aww... there he goes. <slight sniffle>
MIKE: It's okay, Tom, he's going back to join his own. <sees something
      startling in the window> Hey, what's that??

[Mike, Tom, and Crow move to the window. Gypsy still looks occupied. Mys-
terious lights flash from outside, but the viewer can't see the source.]

CROW: Well, what do you know!
TOW: What the-- but that means they--
MIKE: Then she would--
CROW: But he can't--
MIKE: Then what about--

[The lights die down. Mike, Tom and Crow turn away from the window.]

CROW: Wow. This changes everything!
TOM: Yeah, we probably weren't supposed to know that until season 4 at
     least!
MIKE: After seeing that, I'm just glad we got rid of that bear.
GYPSY: Jeffrey.

[pause]

OTHERS: Huh?

[Another pause, then alarms and sirens go off.]

MIKE: Never mind, we've got Ratliff sign!!!


6...5...4...3...2...1...*...

[They enter the theater.]

TOM: Babearlon 5, indeed.

>       On the Red Bridge of the Trakce ship, the Captain was sitting in
> his chair in the aft port corner of the bridge.  

TOM: Hey, can't a guy have a little privacy here?

> In the front of the
> room two officers manned a console going from wall to wall.  The Captain
> wore two red ribbons.  The left one wore a red and a green ribbon.  The
> right Trakce wore a red and a blue ribbon.  

CROW: You know, Stephen, we just DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FRIGGIN' RIBBONS 
      ANYMORE!!
MIKE: Hey, calm down, Crow.

> The Bridge also boasted a brig in the starboard aft corner.

TOM: Ah.  The ship was designed by committee, I see.
CROW: Think of all the heckling the captain must get.

>       Suddenly the door opened up.  The Starfleet Officers burst into
> the room.  "Hands up," Marrissa ordered her phaser pointing at the
> leader.  

MIKE: <Eliot Ness> I got you now, Capone!

> The Trakce hands went toward the ceiling. "Now slowly back
> away from those consoles."

TOM: Now do the hokey-pokey and turn yourself around.

>       When all the Trakce were out of reach of the consoles Marrissa
> ordered, "Ensign Lochard search them."

CROW: And be careful, they're sensitive.  Itching powder kills them.

>       Ross Lochard approached the seven foot tall alien.  Holstering
> his phaser, he began patting him down.  

MIKE: <Ross> Say, do you work out?

> From the alien's back he removed a sword.  

TOM: ...and gave it back to the guy who'd stabbed him.
CROW: There can be only one.    

> On his waist three spikes of some type were removed.  

MIKE: And his pants were headed for the floor!

> The same process was repeated for both of the other Trakce.
>       "Now that you gentlemen have been disarmed, I'd like you to take
> a seat over there in your bridge brig," Marrissa Picard said.  

TOM: Sure, the bridge brig was a bad idea, but it does save on set design.

> "Please
> go slowly and remember that all of the Starfleet personal are in the top

CROW: Uh... so your average Starfleet crewmember is better than 90% of the 
      Enterprise crew?
MIKE: That sounds about right.

>       The Trakce took seats in their own brig and Marrissa began her
> speech, "Now gentlemen, some introductions since I didn't have time
> earlier.  I am Lieutenant junior grade Marrissa Amber Picard, CONN

TOM: You know, she's awful damn proud of that "Flagship" thing.

> My father is the

MIKE: Hellooo...
TOM:     Hellooo...
CROW:       Hellooo...
ALL: HELLO!

>       "You are in big trouble," Marrissa said.  "As a Starfleet

CROW: The U.N. provoked the attack?  I *knew* it was a conspiracy!

TOM: The most serious crime of all!
MIKE: Marrissa Picard: Junior Parking Nazi.

>       "I have nothing to say," The captain said.

CROW: I want my lawyer.

>       "By the way how do you turn off your jamming device?" Marrissa
> asked.  "I'd prefer not to start pressing buttons. I might just hit the
> wrong button and kill your crew."

TOM: <Marrissa> I'm just stupid enough to do it, too!  I'm a danger to 
     myself and others!

>       "I have nothing to say."
>       "You should know that she has done it before," Ross commented as
> if it was a common everyday thing.

MIKE: <Ross> Yeah, Marrissa pretty much slaughters indiscriminately...

>       The red and blue ribboned Trakce spoke up," Five in Four up on
> my console."

CROW: Orgy at his place!  Woo!

>       "Thank you," Marrissa said.

TOM: <Marrissa> ...wuss.

>       "You shouldn't have said that," the Trakce leader scolded his
> crew person. "Now we must die."

MIKE: <German accent> Now is the time on Sprockets when we die!

> 
>       Meanwhile behind the garden wall, Commander Riker had finally
> found some time to check in.  

CROW: <Riker> Well, errands are done, but I still have to pick up the
      dry cleaning...

> "Riker to Enterprise  ... Riker to Enterprise.  Damn.  Riker to Data."
>       "Data here."

TOM: <Data> I'm right next to you.

>       "My communication with the Enterprise has been cut off," Riker
> said.
>       "My communication suffers the same fault," Data's voice said.

MIKE: Do you think there could be a connection?

>       "I'm pinned down behind a garden wall," Riker informed.  

CROW: That's the last time *I* try planting tulips!

> "A couple of Trakce are firing on us from behind a wall surrounding their
> ship.  

TOM: So Marrissa kills about 200 Trakce in a matter of minutes, but Riker
     can't handle *two* of them?

MIKE: <Picard> I know she's out there... somewhere... plotting against me...

CROW: He must have been seriously delirious.
TOM: I hope she isn't going to play Bob Seger and dance around in her 
     underwear.

CROW: Well, first the electrochemical activity dies down, then...

CROW: But that's not fair!  Marrissa's the one who gave her the cookies!

>       "I'll pay you we I get off duty," Clara replied.  Noticing
> Heather, Corey, and Sam she asked, "New recruits?"

TOM: Fresh meat.

>       "No," Marrissa replied.  "These are the children I rescued from 
> the Trakce.  Heather O'Brien, Corey O'Brien, and Sam Lynch.  

MIKE: Miles and Keiko have been busier than we thought, apparently.

> Dad ordered
> me do give them a tour before they return to the planet's surface."

CROW: A taste of the good life, then back to the slave pits.

>       "I guess its time for the two minute tour of Engineering then,"
> Clara said.  

TOM: Only two minutes?
CROW: Well, it *is* a small set.

> "Follow me.  This is the Master Situation Monitor ..."

MIKE: <Torgo> ThE MAsTeR wOuLDn'T aPpROve oF SitUAtIoNs...

TOM: <Marrissa> But I haven't finished showing these spies all our secrets.
CROW: Hey, that'd be a fun plot twist.
MIKE: Yeah, but this is Ratliff.  No plot twists allowed.

>       "Thank you Counselor," Marrissa said  "Would you give my friends

> entered the ready room.

TOM: <Troi> Well, this is, uh, the bridge.

>       A couple minutes later she returned and said, "The Captain has

> Lieutenants Anton and Felix, the Captain has some duties in his ready

MIKE: He needs to do a scene with some acting in it.

> Heather O'Brien take CONN, Corey Ops; Sam, aft stations."

CROW: <jaw hangs open>
TOM: <laughing> What?!  Okay, they're little kids, they've never been on 
     board a starship until now, and they're going to take control of the 
     Battle Bridge?
MIKE: <kid voice> Do you know how any of this stuff works?
TOM: <ditto> No.  Just keep pressing buttons until something blows up.

>       The exchange of places was made with Marrissa taking tactical.

CROW: Duh... not... sense... making...
MIKE: <grabs Crow> Snap out of it, buddy!

> "Marrissa why are you amused?" Counselor Troi asked.  

TOM: <Marrissa> Oh, the idea of kids in control of a fully armed battleship 
     just cracks me up!

>       "You will find out soon enough," Marrissa smiled.

CROW: <Marrissa> You will die soon enough!

>       Over the intercom Captain Picard announced, "Commence Bridge
> Battle Drill."

MIKE: Insert another 25 cents.

>       "Romulan Warbird De-cloaking directly ahead," Marrissa announced.
>       "Raise shields and hail them Lieutenant," Troi replied.
>       "No response, They are powering their weapons," Marrissa
> responded.

TOM: What a surprise, this being a *battle* drill and all.

>       "Ready phasers and photon torpedoes ..."

CROW: And get me a real crew!

TOM: Ah.  The second book is over, I see.
CROW: Ratliff's stories don't really *end*; they just kind of taper out.

MIKE: And a sudden attack of sense in the Starfleet command structure.
CROW: Holy cow, Ratliff's a boy scout!
TOM: That would explain a *lot*.

MIKE: Well, hey!  Sucking up to your boss *does* pay off!

> He also began dating Ensign Katherine Szustakowski.

CROW: That's great, but WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING??

>       Clara Sutter spent a week as acting Chief Engineer.  

TOM: Nobody was smart enough to replace her, I see.

> Most of Engineering came to Counselor Troi that week with feelings of

CROW: ...after they found out that Clara had a bigger--
MIKE: CROW!

> Shortly after her tenure as Chief Engineer, Clara

> "Mathematical analysis of Possible New Warp Power Asymptotes." 

TOM: At that point, her chances of being cool were ruined for life.

> Since not

CROW: ...by the three people who read it.

>       The Enterprise itself crash landed and was declared
> unsalvegable.  

MIKE: <giggles> What... just like that?
CROW: Could this have something to do with having so many *kids* in charge?
TOM: Uh... nurk... AAARRGH! <his head explodes, Mike grabs him>

> While waiting reassignment the crew of the Enterprise was
> bombarded by the media.  

CROW: Oh, so it was *reporters* who destroyed the Enterprise!
MIKE: <waving smoke away from Tom's head> Tom?  Tom, speak to me!

> Of particular interest to them was Marrissa, due to her rank and age.  

MIKE: And her one-time friendship with O.J.
CROW: Hey Mike, is Servo okay?

> In fact she become the media darling of
> Starfleet until they began getting on her nerves.

CROW: *They* began getting on *her* nerves?

>       The Trakce however still wanted a child for their plans.

MIKE: So they decided to adopt.
TOM: <woozily> Oooh, lookit the pretty pixels.

> Unfortunately for them, for them third time is not a charm.

CROW: Now *there's* some subtle foreshadowing.
MIKE: Come on, we've got to get Tom out of here.
TOM: Duuuhhhhh.... daaaaaaaaiiiiiuuuurrrrr....

[They leave the theater.]

1...2...3...4...5...6...*...

[SOL.  Servo is sitting on the counter.  His head is broken and smoke
billows out of it.  Mike is intent on trying to fix Servo while Crow 
looks on.]

CROW: So, Mike, that's the end of another "book?"
MIKE: <distracted> Yep.
CROW: Was there any dramatic tension in there?
MIKE: <again> Nope, just a meteoric rise through the ranks.
CROW: Ah, like a Clancy novel.

[Tom begins to move his head back and forth slowly.]

TOM: Snxbble grnklph... dhdkhcvwefs... qwertyuiop...
MIKE: Tom, speak to me, buddy!

[Tom swivels his head faster than before.]

TOM: WOOP WOOP WOOP!  YAAHH!!  <stops swivelling, pauses>  What happened?
MIKE: You fizzled out on us towards the end, there.
TOM: Oh yeah.  I remember... the Enterprise exploded for no reason,
     or something like that.
CROW: <nervously> Yeah, I wonder what the heck he was talking about.
MIKE: Well, he was obviously referring to "Star Trek: Generations".
TOM: Huh?
CROW: <whisper> Uh, no, Mike...
MIKE: Yeah, the Enterprise blew up at the end of the movie.
TOM: "Generations"?
CROW: <harsher whisper> MIKE!
MIKE: You remember, don't you?  The final union of old generation and
      next, in which Kirk and Picard team up in the Happy Ribbon to
      stop Dr. Soran?
TOM: Oh yeah... "Generations."  Now I remember.  Thanks, Mike.  <pause>
     NNNYYYYYUUUUUAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGHHH!!!!

[Servo's head explodes not once, not twice, but THREE times.  He 
collapses on the counter and doesn't move.]

MIKE: Holy cow!
CROW: Great going, Mike.  Servo had to go through months of intense 
      therapy after seeing "Generations", and he had *just* gotten 
      to the point where he could watch "Tekwar" without babbling 
      incoherently, when YOU come along and ruin EVERYTHING.
MIKE: Jeez, I'm sorry, Crow, I didn't know...
CROW: I only hope he can be helped after this latest setback.
MIKE: I'm sorry, I really had no idea...

[Buzzers and lights go off.]

MIKE: AAAHHHH!  WE GOT FANFIC SIGN!
TOM: Urk.
