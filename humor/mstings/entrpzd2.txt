tales of the Satellite of Love - namely, how Mike learned
about RAM chips as well as the first time Mike hears
Crow's Lloyd Bridges imitation.

<The Satellite of Love. Tom is on the counter; Crow is beside him.
  Gypsy is over in the corner.>
Crow: [to Tom] Feel yourself relax... let yourself drift...
Gypsy: Ommmm......
Tom: Ommmmm....
Crow: That's right, just breathe deeply and chant along with Gypsy.
Gypsy: Ommm...
Tom: Ommmmmm...
Crow: Now, you are at peace with yourself...
Gypsy: Ommm...
Tom: Ommmmmm...
Crow: Get in touch with the Ratliff in your soul...
Gypsy: Ommm...
Tom: Ommmmmm...
Crow: His name no longer causes you pain...
Gypsy: Ommm...
Tom: Ommmmmm...
Crow: Now, wake up and take a deep cleansing breath.
Tom: [snaps back to alertness] Oh, wow! Thanks, Crow! I feel
	so much better!
Mike: [entering] Hey, guys, what's going on?
Tom: Crow just cured me.
Mike: Hey, great! I was worried about you last time. I can't
	believe your head exploded just from you seeing *his* name.
Tom: I'm all better now. Nary a twinge.
Mike: So you don't mind if I say his name?
Tom: Nope. [to himself] No pain, no pain at all.
Mike: Okay.... Ratliff!
Tom: You mean... *Stephen* Ratliff?
Mike: Wow! Crow, I'm impressed!
Crow: Nothin' to it.
Mike: Listen, you think you can cure me of howling in agony
	every time I hear a Whitney Houston song?
Crow: Mike, bear in mind this *is* still a new science.
Mike: Oh. Okay. [commercial sign flashes] We'll be right back.
[he hits the button]

<commercial break... Mentos ads galore>

<the Satellite>
Gypsy: Crow, I'm so impressed. You showed such skill!
Crow: Ah, it was nothing.
Gypsy: And Tom, you were so brave to confront your fear like that!
Tom: Hey, baby, sometimes a bot's gotta do what a bot's gotta do.
Mike: I'm just glad you're cured, Tom.
Tom: Me too. It's like a weight has been lifted...
[light flashes]
Crow: Hey, Targ and Puthoff are calling.
Tom: I think the weight is about to descend again.
[Mike hits the button]
<Deep 13>
Dr. F: Hello, Moroni. Are you ready for this week's invention exchange?
<Satellite>
Mike: I sure am. You remember those magic tricks you had as a kid,
	where you put in a blank piece of paper, turned a crank,
	and got a dollar bill? Oh, sure, they weren't real, but we had 
	fun pretending.
<Deep 13>
Frank: They weren't real?
<SOL>
Mike: Anyway, my invention works on a similar concept.
	[Mike shows a huge version of one of those magic tricks] I call it
	the Crichtonograph. You put a ream of blank paper in one end, and a
	novel spills out the other end! [he demonstrates] And the best part
	is, it'll make you rich and famous! Of course, it doesn't mean the
	book'll be any good, but then, you can't have anything.
<Deep 13>
Dr. F: Interesting, Merriweather. We seem to be on the same wavelength
	this week. Our invention, however, is based on those magic tricks 
	where you put in a dollar bill and get back a blank piece of paper.
	We call this evil little device... the Ratliffer! [Frank, at keyboard, 
	makes a dramatic chord as Dr. F. whips the sheet off of the Ratliffer.
	It looks exactly like Mike's Crichtonograph, only it's neon green
	while Mike's is red.]
Dr. F:  Yes, all you do with the Ratliffer is put a good fanfic in at
	one end, turn the crank, and out comes a putrid, poorly-written,
	ungrammatical nightmare worthy of Stephen Ratliff. Frank, 
	would you demonstrate?
Frank: Sure, Steve. Here [he holds up a fanfic] is Michael Franz's excellent
	work, "Synchronicity." It's a Dr. Who / Next Generation crossover 
	fanfic. It's well-written, conforms to all laws of grammar, contains
	actual character development *and* it's a good story. Now, we 
	just throw it in... [he puts the fanfic in and turns the crank]
	... and we get [dramatic flourish] "Cyborged" by Simon Jerram, based 
	on ideas by Dave Yadalee!
<SOL>
All: Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
Tom: My *God*, have you no sense of decency?
Crow: That's not funny, that's *sick!*
Mike: That was the most evil thing I've ever seen.
<Deep 13>
Dr. F: [sincerely flattered] Thank you, thank you very much. 
	[he turns brusque] Well, it was only a matter of time before Stephen
	Ratliff once again took to the keyboard. I gave you a polite warning, 
	and now you get the real thing. I give you... the conclusion of
	"Enterprized."
<SOL>
Crow: Remember, Tom, no pain. No pain.
Gypsy: Ommmm....
Tom: Ommm...
Crow: No pain.
Tom: No pain!
[fanfic sign flashes]
Mike & Crow: Ahhhh!! We've got fanfic sign!
Tom: AHHHHH!!! PAIN!!!

[Door sequence]
[They enter the theater]
Crow: Once more into the breach, guys.
Tom: [to himself] No pain. No pain.

Tom: Plus, who *really* shot J.R.! Stay tuned! Ok, guys, let's go...

[They get up to exit]
Mike: How you holding up there, Tom?
Tom: Okay. I'm okay.
Crow: I told you it would work, Tom.

[The group exits the theater]
[Door sequence]

<SOL, the bridge>
Mike: Hey, you guys haven't seen my copy of "Imzadi," have you?
Tom: Oh, Mike, reading Peter David *again*? He's a hack!
Crow: Aw, you're just saying that 'cause you hated "The Seige."
Tom: It was hideous!
Crow: Are you kidding? That book was incredible! It's almost
	as good as "Road House!"
Tom: I rest my case.
Mike: Tom, Peter David is actually pretty good. "The Seige"
	was sub-par for him, and that's unfortunate, but you can't let
	that one book ruin him for you. Hey, you liked "Alien Nation," so
	why not try reading #3, "Body and Soul?" It's pretty good.
Tom: No way. Look, you said, "Tom, you should really try reading
	a Trek novel. They're actually pretty good." I agree, and Crow
	hands me this piece of cow poop -
Crow: Hey!
Mike: Hang on, I'm gonna go look in the theater. [He exits.]
Crow: "The Seige" is not cow poop! I'm telling you, it's almost
	as good as "Road House."
Tom: Well, there we agree.
Crow: Yeah. [pause] Huh?
Mike: [from off-camera] OW!
Crow: What the heck was that?
Tom: It sounded like Mike. Hey Mike, you okay?
Mike: [enters holding his head. He has a jar full of RAM chips.]
Crow: WOW! Mike, where'd you -
Tom: [sotto voce, to Crow] Shhhh!! Let me do the talking. 
[to Mike] Mike, what happened?
Mike: Well, as I was going into the theater, I tripped on that grate...
Tom: The one you have to carry me over?
Mike: Yeah, that one. Anyway, a corner was loose, and I tripped on it.
Crow: So where'd you -
Tom: Shhh! [to Mike] What's in the jar?
Mike: I dunno. Looks like RAM chips. [Crow smacks his lips]
Tom: [whisper] Quiet, Crow. [to Mike] Where'd you find them?
Mike: In the grate. I wonder what they were doing there.
Crow: [whispers] That must be where Joel was hiding them!
Tom: [whispers] Shhh! [to Mike] Ohh, *I* know. We ran out of
	room in the closet, so we had to put them down there for safekeeping.
	I guess we just forgot about them.
Mike: Weird. What do you use them for?
[Pause]
Tom: Oh, er, lots of things.
Crow: Yeah, lots of things. [Smacks lips, whispers] Yum!
Tom: Er... [laughs nervously; nudges Crow] Listen, Mike,
	why don't you give them to me? I know where to put 'em.
Mike: Tom, you don't have any functional arms.
Tom: Crow can help me!
Crow: Yeah! I can help! Yeah yeah yeah!!!
Mike: Hmm. Well, in that case, here you go. [he puts the 
	RAM chips on the counter] I'm gonna go check my room for
	my book. [he exits]
[Crow & Tom watch him go. When he is long gone, they turn to
each other and laugh maniacally. The laughter continues as commercial
sign flashes. Crow falls forward (still laughing) and hits the button.
The maniacal laughter continues into commercial fadeout.]

[commercial break - what are you, plant life?]

[SOL, back on the bridge. Tom and Crow are sprawled on the
console. The empty RAM chip jar is on its side on the console.]

Tom: Oooooooohhhh.....
Crow: ohhhhhhhhhh...
[a brief pause]
Tom: Ooooooooooohhhhhhhh.......
Crow: oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
[another brief pause]
Tom: I think I'm going to be sick.
Crow: UCK! [turns over and retches]
Tom: Oooooooooooohhhhh.....
Crow: [retches again]
[Mike walks in]
Mike: What the -?
Tom: Oogh...
Crow: Uck. Ick. Argh. [Retches again]
Mike: What happened, guys?
Tom: We ate... all the RAM chips.
Mike: Oh. [pause] Is that bad?
Tom: YES!! Yes, dammit, it IS bad!! Why didn't you
	stop us, guide us, say "No, if you eat all the RAM chips
	you'll get sick!"
Mike: I didn't know. 
Tom: This isn't a game, Mike. This is indigestion.
Crow: [Retches again]
Mike: Hang on, I'll get some Pepto-Bismol. [He runs off, just
as the Mads call. Crow retches again, and accidentally hits
the button].
<Deep 13>
Dr. F: What in the name of George Bush?
<SOL>
[Tom and Crow are both retching]
<Deep 13>
Dr. F: I've done it! I've done it! Frank, look! I've done it!
Frank: Done what?
Dr. F: I gave them a fanfic that actually made them physically ill!
	[gets faraway look in his eyes] Oh, the papers... the conferences...
	the tenure! Frank, this is wonderful!
<SOL>
Mike: [pouring the pink stuff down Crow's throat] Don't get all
	excited, sirs. They just ate too many RAM chips.
Tom: Hey, hurry up with that Pepto, Mike! I need the one that
	coats!
<Deep 13> 
Dr. F: [hyperventilates]
Frank: Don't worry, Steve. Ratliff will make them puke yet.
Dr. F: I know... I know... [laughs maniacally]
<SOL>
[Crow is lying back in Pepto-Bismol induced bliss. Mike is giving
Tom Pepto by putting the pink stuff on his own finger, then sliding
the finger into Tom's mouth, reminiscent of Olivier & Dustin 
Hoffman in "Marathon Man."]
Tom: More. [Mike gives more.] More. [Mike gives more.]
	[light flashes] Fanfic sign. [Mike gives more.] Fanfic sign.
	[Mike gives more.] Fanfic sign!
Mike: AHHH!! Fanfic sign!
Crow: I'm gonna puke again! [retches]

[Door sequence]

Mike: [to Crow] You gonna be okay, honey?
Crow: Yeah, I think so.

Mike: Only sometimes.

Crow: [falsetto] A Romulan warbird.

Tom: I hope it stays that way.

Tom: Nope.
Crow: Uh-uh.

Crow: [falsetto] I had such a dream! And you - and you - and you
	were there!

Mike: An Electra complex?
Tom: Okay, I'd like to nominate "fummed" as the funniest Ratliff
	misspelling yet.
Crow: Hey, Tom! You made two grammar flames in a row - you're
	gonna lose your RAM chips - urk! [retches]
Tom: Gotcha! Hey, I see you've been reading alt.tv.mst3k!
Mike: We have a USENET group?
Tom: Mike, don't shout.
Mike: I'm not shouting, I - oh, never mind.

Crow: Not to mention the famous Yar overacting.
Mike: Hey, Tom, what about the way he constantly misspells the names
	of major characters?
Tom: Hmm. I'll take that into consideration.
Crow: You guys are gonna lose your [dry heaves] ulp. Almost
	got me again, Servo.

Crow: Mike, aren't you reading a *little* too much into this?

Tom: Let's get out before it starts up again.
[they exit]

<Bridge of the Satellite of Love>

Crow: Not since JFK has there been such a stunning expose of
	the Kennedy conspiracy!
Mike: What do you mean?
Crow: What do I mean? What do I mean? I'll tell you what I mean!
Tom: So tell us already!
Crow: You're ruining my buildup.
Tom: Oh. Sorry.
Crow: What I mean is this. The bicycle will never replace the horse.
	On the other hand, the horse will never replace the bicycle. Which is
	quite a horse on a bicycle if I ever saw one, and I don't think I ever
	saw one.
Tom: Crow, you're spouting Marxist philosophy!
Crow: I'm sorry! I'm just so darn *excited!*
Mike: About what?
Crow: Joe McGinniss is a pen name.
Tom: [gasps]
Mike: You mean -
Crow: YES! Stephen Ratliff wrote "The Last Brother!"
[Dramatic chord]
[A moment's pause]
Mike: Crow, that's a pretty dramatic accusation.
Tom: Yeah, Crow. I hope you have some proof.
Crow: Proof? Oh, do I *ever* have proof! [He paces about as
	he speaks.] Exhibit A: "The Last Brother" is a crappy unauthorized
	biography, and "Enterprized" is a crappy unauthorized fanfic.
Tom: Pure coincidence!
Crow: [dramatic turn] Is it? Exhibit B: Both authors 
	don't use a middle name!
Mike: I dunno, Crow...
Crow: Just wait! Exhibit C: Both authors are right-handers!
Tom: You're guessing!
Crow: You're right! Exhibit D: Both authors brush their teeth!
Mike: I hope so.

[Crow is still going strong. Mike, however, has his head resting in
his hands and his elbows resting on the console. Tom is asleep,

Crow: Exhibit X: Because I say so! Exhibit - hey, where was I?
Mike: Huh?
Crow: Shoot. I guess I have to start over. Exhibit A -
Mike: No, that's okay, Crow. You made your point.
Crow: And...?
Mike: And I have to wake up Tom. [he shakes Tom gently]
Tom: Huh? What? Oh, hi guys. I had the weirdest dream.
Mike: What?
Tom: I dreamt Stephen Ratliff shot JFK.
Crow: AHA! There *is* a connection! I knew it!
Tom: What?
Crow: I knew it! I knew I was right! Hahaha!
[Crow runs off babbling]
Mike: Weird.
[fanfic sign flashes]
Tom: Fanfic sign, Mike.

Tom: I know, I know... but right now, all I feel is joy! [Music starts]
Crow: I smell a song coming on!
Tom: [sings, tune is roughly that of "The Minstrel Boy"]
	This fanfic to the winds has gone;
	In /dev/null now you'll find it.
	Stephen spelled ev'ry word wrong,
	and made grammar flamers excited.
	"Enterprized" was truly bad,
	that in faith I grant ye.
	But now it's done, there is no more;
	so let us all be happy.
Crow: [sings]
	Stephen, now to you I sing,
	to you I turn attention.
	The awful plot, next to your weak
	writing skills must take mention.
	I hope that you will end your work,
	and listen to the net.mob.
	Hearken well to what we say,
	and please don't quit your day job.
Mike: [sings]
	So now we end our little song,
	We thank you all for listening.
	We hope your lives are happy and long,
	and that you grab the brass ring.
	USENET, we are sorry for
	the burden heaped upon you.
	May you heal from Ratliff's sore,
	And Jerram and Yadalee's also.

Mike: Hey, sirs, I was wondering. If your invention can turn a 
	good fanfic into Ratliff-esque material, what would happen if
	you put Ratliff into it?

Dr. F: [looks uncomfortable] Macaroon, there are simply some

Dr. F: It's something called "The Seige," by Peter David.
