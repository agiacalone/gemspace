Mike: Hi everybody.  My name is Mike and I'm an avatar.

Tom & Crow: Hi Mike!

Mike: For those of you just joining us, Tom, Crow and myself are pure energy. 
	But we've been trapped in a Radford University Experimental 
	Internetlink satellite by Mrs. Forrester.

Crow: And she's making us read Ratliff's fanfics, here in this text-based 
	environment.

Tom: And it's all hot and it hurts and stuff.

Mike: And we'll be right back.

[SOL Bridge -- or, rather, a text-based mock up of same]

Mike: Crow, I hope you're happy.  I can't believe you got us stuck here.

Crow: Come on, Mike.  How was I supposed to know Pearl would do this to us?  
	Besides, Tommy and I are kinda getting used to this MUD thing.

Tom: Yeah, watch this.

Tom declares a Holy PieWar (tm) on Crow for getting us stuck here.
Tom pulls a Key Lime from his PieHolster and lobs it at Crow.
Direct Hit! He got Key Lime all over Crow!

Crow whacks Tom with Killer Shrew.
Tom whacks Crow with Rat Pack Chess Set.
Crow whacks Tom with Gutter-Bumber-Chute.
Tom whacks Crow with Dull Surprise!

PearlF @knocks and asks if she can join you.

Mike: Enough you two.  Rosemary and Adrian are calling.

PearlF materializes out of nowhere.

Mrs. F: Hello, Art.  Bots.

Mike: Wait a min-

Mrs. F: Just stopped by to let you know that there's a new bit of Ratliff 
	poopie coming up the cyberpike.  It's called "A New Generation."  The 
	only thing new is the pain.  It's in ten parts.

Crow: Oh, we can handle a tenth of Ratliff.

Mrs. F: Yes, I'm sure you could.  But since you're all eternal and pure and 
	immortal, time has no meaning to you.  You'll be getting all ten 
	parts at once.

Tom: Wha- huh?

Mrs. F: It would take a scientist to explain, and Clayton is still in 	
	diapers. Anyway, I'll be logging your session and playing the 	
experiment for Clayton on his baby monitor. It seems to keep him 	quiet.

Mike [Riker]: Are Klingons ticklish there?

Tom: Zero Mostel stars! In "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Worf's Room."

Crow: What with uninformed environmental doomsaying, his technoblather, his

Crow: Ah, they couldn't even take the Lubbock Babes.

Tom [Worf]: "Will, this may not be the best time for this, but have you

Mike: Mr. Quatre
Tom: Ms. Cinq
Crow: Dr. Six

Tom: Really?

Crow: Sure.  I'm kind of responsible for letting Mother Forrester trap us,

Tom: Crow, you didn't @create anything!  Mike, some of the wires here in this

Mike: Hey guys, still playing with your action figures?

Tom: Sure are!

Mike: Um, why?

Mike: So, Crow, what do you have there?

Crow: Oh, I sent away the proofs of purchase, and I got this bonus!  It's the

Mike: Uh-huh.

Crow: See, here's his reference shelf: The Star Trek Omnipedia, The 	
	Nitpicker's Guide to the Next Generation, The Novelization of 	
	"Disaster" ...

Mike: What? He calls himself a writer?  Where's his Roget's, his OED, his 
	Strunk and White??!

Crow: What in the name of Judge Luther Charbonnet would Ratliff do with those? 
 	Read them?

Mike: Good point.

Tom: You know, this is why I can't help but feel sorry for these characters. I 
	mean, there they are, minding there own business, happily existing in

	sudden their very souls are twisted, and they're transported into some 
	warped facsimile of their own world by some drooling, semi-literate 
	fanboy!

Crow: Poor slobs.  The thing is, it's not just pity I feel.  There's empathy, 
	too.

Tom: Yeah, me too.  Why do you suppose that is?

Mike: You've got me.  I feel certain bond with them, too. Weird.

Tom: Okay.  But who or what is "A New Generation?"
Crow: What with all the excitemnet and action, Ratliff must have forgotten

Mike: Well, maybe something will happen. Let's watch.

Tom: Whew. Let's get out of here, guys.

[1-2-3-4-5-6]

[SOL]

Mike: Wow, guys, that was rough.

Tom: Mike, if we're so immortal and internal and stuff, why are we trapped in 
	geosynchronous orbit over Radford University, trapped in a text-based 
	mock up of the Satellite of Love?

Mike: How should I know.

Crow: You know, trapped up here in cyberspace, reading about the Kids' Crew, 
	orbiting Radford.  Face it guys, it's Ratliff's World, and we're just 
	passing through.

Mike: Crow!  I think that's it!

Crow: What?

Mike: This *is* Ratliff's world.

Crow: And? 

Mike: Who is all-powerful in Ratliff's world?

Crow: Marrissa.

Mike: Exactly.  Tom, do you have the Marrissa action figure?

Tom: Sure do, Mike.  Right here.

Mike: All we have to do is have Marrissa wave her hand, and we'll be banished 
	from Ratliff's world.

[Mike takes the figure, and lifts its hand.] 

Mike [Marrissa]: Be gone, infidels!

Mike, Tom, and Crow all disappear.

Mrs. F: Oh, no!  How did they escape?

<Baby crying>

Mrs. F: I'm sorry, Clayton.  I'll get them back soon enough.  I've got this
