[MSTH set. As the opening theme plays, "Jack Perkins" is standing
motionless (as usual), and there is a small U.S. flag on the column 
beside him.]

PERKINS: Hello, and welcome. Tonight, we celebrate the good old American
         tradition of free speech. First up is a lesson on the roots of
         the American Revolution-- did you know that King Louis XV was 
         directly responsible for the Constitution? For our main course,
         a crossover story by John F. Moore III, a man who sticks to his
         own personal spelling rules with such conviction-- he should be
         an example for us all. So, sit back and enjoy a patriotic Mys- 
         tery Science Theater Hour.

[SoL. Servo and Crow are the only ones visible. They are trying hard not
to laugh.]

SERVO: Hello, everyone. Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot here, and we're...
       [goes into uncontrollable giggling]

CROW: [gasping for breath] We're just waiting for Joel to find out... 
      <snicker> what we... <hee hee>

SERVO: [whispers] Oh, here he comes!

[Cambot pulls out a bit as Joel walks into view, wearing a jumpsuit
whose colors have run. Once evenly-colored, it now looks like something
designed by the Grateful Dead.]

SERVO: [clears throat] Hi, Joel, how're you doing?

JOEL: I think someone needs to have a lecture about inappropriate deter- 
      gents.

SERVO: But Joel, it looks so much better now!

CROW: Yeah! I bet all the women'll-- *dye*!

[Both 'bots start laughing out loud. The "commercial sign" button
flashes.]

JOEL: We'll be right back. [hits button]

[Commercials, commercials, commercials. Coming up at 9...]

[Back at the SoL, Joel has changed into an unaffected jumpsuit. Servo
and Crow have calmed down.]

SERVO: So you're not really mad at us? Not just a bit?

CROW: No time outs or anything?

JOEL: No, let's just let bygones be bygones. That was pretty clever of 
      you guys, actually. I wouldn't have expected you to do something
      like that when some of your clothes were in the wash, too.

CROW: What?

SERVO: You... no!

JOEL: Yup. [pulls a basket of assorted clothing, in the same state as 
      his earlier jumpsuit, out from under the counter]

SERVO: My nurse's-- I mean, my surgical gown!

CROW: You've been washing *my* loose-fitting jeans with *your* underoos
      all along?

JOEL: Yeah, you guys are really smart! [the big red button flashes] Oh,
      the Mads are calling. [hits button]

DR. F: Hello, booby! Our invention exchange this week is aimed at the 
       Generation X market. Frank?

FRANK: Earrings are out. Nose rings are passe. Eyebrow rings are in. This
       is your brain on drugs. Live in Arizona. It'z new, it'z--

DR. F: [pushing Frank off-camera] Forget it, Frank. As you know, today's
       youth are experimenting with piercing every body part imaginable.
       Our studies also show that they're always forgetting their keys.
       The answer?

FRANK: [bouncing right back] Key rings!

DR. F: But not just ordinary key rings! [picks up some variously-sized
       key rings] Ours are specially made to fit through any part of the
       body. Now you can combine the comfort-- so to speak-- of riding
       the latest fashion wave with the confidence of knowing you'll 
       always be able to use your getaway vehicle. Your turn, Joel.

[The basket of clothes has vanished, and on the counter there is now a
four-cup coffee machine, decorated with Celtic interlaces.]

CROW: Can I have my beak pierced?

JOEL: No, honey, it'll get infected.

CROW: Aww.

JOEL: Well, sirs, our invention this week is also based on some new 
      trends. Almost everyone who lives in downtown Seattle knows that 
      the wave of the future is made up of gourmet coffee, Celtic music,
      and karaoke. That's why we've put together the Celtic Coffee Ka- 
      raoke Machine! Check it out-- you can make just one cup--

[He switches the machine on. The uneven percolating of coffee into one
cup eventually becomes recognizable as a less-than-thrilling rendition
of "Twa' Corbies".]

CROW: --or up to four, while singing along with your favorite ancient 
      tunes!

[The machine lauches into a four-part-harmonic bludgeoning of "Tom
O'Bedlam". Joel indicates a microphone hooked up to the machine, then
picks up something that looks like a miniature hopper and puts it on top
of the machine.]

SERVO: And for those of you who enjoy mixing your own special coffees, 
       this handy grinding attachment!

[Joel picks up a scoopful of coffee beans and pours them into the
hopper. A grinding noise joins the dripping in an utterly hideous
performance of "Black Jack Davy".]

JOEL: What do you think, sirs?

<>

[Frank, standing in the background, is wearing a gigantic key ring,
which runs in one of his ears and out the other.]

DR. F: Your torture for today follows in the footsteps of "Star Dwarf" 
       and "Highleaper". It's a Star Trek-Higlander crossover called  
       "Treklander", and it's really, really... not very good. But   
       first, a brief homage to ineffectual monarchy. Bon appe-die! 
       [pushes button]

[Alarms are going off, lights are flashing, and the Celtic Coffee
Karaoke Machine is pumping out an unbearable version of "Fair John and
the Seven Foresters".]

JOEL: We got message sign!

[Everyone runs like heck.]

SERVO: [as "MacLoud"] Stop looking at me! NOW!

CROW: They're the wackiest pair of cut-ups ever to... uh, that's right,
      I'm an android. I'm not allowed to be funny.

>   "They are Embassador MacLoud and his assistant Richard.  They are on

>   "You don't say...I think those two need a drink."

JOEL: I think anybody who reads this thing needs a drink.

>   A waiter approached MacLoud and Richard with two glasses.
>   Richard looked confused.  "But we didn't order...?"

SERVO: Order, schmorder.  There's a two-drink minimum here.

>   "They're compliments from...an old friend," the waiter explained.
>   "Who is this `old friend'?" asked MacLoud.

CROW: Oh, just take the free drinks and shut up!

>   "An anonymous one...by the being's request."  The waiter left

JOEL: Absentmindedly leaving his period behind.

>   Richard looked agitated.  "Great!  We may be in danger and we don't

SERVO: It's so unfair!  I was only trained to fight enemies who an-
       nounced themselves in advance!

>   MacLoud looked around.  "Calm down Richie.  The last thing we want

JOEL: Er, maybe we should have thought of that before we got dressed...

SERVO: Well, enough of that-- on to the next plot point!

>   Captain Picard sat in his ready room when his door chimed.

>   Riker entered the ready room.
>   "Yes Number One?"
>   "Permission to speak candidly, sir?"

CROW: Your fly is open.

>   "Of course.  What's on your mind?"

JOEL: Uh, lymph, sir.

>   "I don't trust Embassador MacLoud sir.  When we were in Ten Forward
> he appeared to be looking for something rather intently." 

SERVO: Over to your left, in that alcove.  I really think Guinan should
       put up a sign or something...

>   "Do you think he plans on endangering the Enterprise?"
>   "I don't know sir, but Lt. Worf ran a routine scan on the Embassador
> and found a sword on his person." 

CROW: Well, that settles it.  The ship's endangered, all right...

>   "A sword, Number One?"
>   "Hidden beneath his robes.  A sword was also found in his

SERVO: *Two* guys with swords?  They must be planning a takeover!

>   "I'll have Lt. Worf keep an eye on our guests, but Councillor Troi 
> doesn't sense any hostility toward us."

JOEL: So if they kill us, we'll be comforted by the knowledge that it 
      was never anything personal.

>   "One other thing I noticed in Ten Forward sir...MacLoud's assistant

>   "Could his assistant be a bodyguard, Number One?"

SERVO: No, he's a juggler. The swords are part of the act.

>   "I don't know sir.  MacLoud doesn't strike me as the type who would

CROW: Then again, he hasn't struck me at all yet.

[Zeveral commercialz later...]

[SoL bridge. Joel, Servo, and Crow are all wearing Enterprise-style
badges. Joel is also wearing a fake beard, a beard that practically
screams, "Who the hell am I fooling?" Gypsy, dressed as Guinan, is
pacing purposefully about behind them.]

CROW: [as Data] Captain, reports show that the situation is worsening.
      Bite me.

JOEL: [as Riker] Sir, I strongly feel we should do something.

SERVO: [as Picard] The Prime Directive, Number One. You know it as well
       as I. Wait, [starting to slip out of Picard mode] did Data just
       say "bite me"? Data doesn't say "bite me"!

JOEL: Uh, it's, uh, his evil twin, Lore! Oh no!

CROW: For my research on humanity this week, I've decided to study the
      habits of one of the great 20th-century personalities, one Crow T.
      Robot. Millions of humans patterned their lifestyles after him.

SERVO: Great personality? I don't *think* so!

CROW: Bite me.

JOEL: Hey, calm down, you guys. Let's just get on with the skit.

SERVO: Okay. Um, where were we?

JOEL: Uh...

CROW: Bite me.

SERVO: Crow!!

JOEL: C'mon, Crow, stop that. The, uh, situation. [back to Riker mode]
      I feel we should do something, sir.

[Gypsy paces across in the foreground once.]

SERVO: Under the Prime Directive, we can do nothing.

CROW: Captain, our sensors indicate the situation has reached a critical
      point. Bite me.

SERVO: Aw, heck, phaser them all. You only live once. Shoot those ships,
       too. We've already shot this whole skit. [glares at Crow, then
       does a very good imitation of stomping off, for someone who does-
       n't even have feet]

[Joel sighs and takes the fake beard off.]

CROW: You think it was something I said?

[Joel looks like he's about to say something rather acidic, but the mo-
vie light flashes, alarms go off, etc.]

JOEL: Message sign!

[The picture freezes with Joel about to hit the big red button. The fake
beard has flown out of his hand, and is on a collision course with
Gypsy, whose costume is falling into disarray. Servo is a blurry shape
just at the edge of the picture, and Crow is in a random state of panic.
Fade to the MSTH set, where "Jack Perkins" is holding a large sword.
Another sword is resting against the column next to him.]

PERKINS: [pointless chuckle] It just goes to show that, like a high jump
         and a low ceiling, some things just don't mix. Well, that's all
         for tonight, but tune in next time for the Mystery Science The-
         ater Hour.

talking with Perkins. Roll theme...]

==================8<================================8<====================

[MSTH set. Well, what were you expecting-- Disneyland? The MSTH theme
plays, the lights come up, and "Jack Perkins" is there as usual.]

PERKINS: Welcome to another rollicking Mystery Science Theater Hour. 
         When we last saw our friends, they were in the middle of John 
         F. Moore's gripping psychological drama, "Treklander".

         Starfleet "Embassador" Duncan "MacLoud" and his assistant Rich-
         ie have joined the Next Generation Enterprise crew on a peace-
         keeping mission. No sooner have they come on board than they  
         discover two more Immortals, Guinan and Ensign Cathaway, with 
         whom they become friends after what seems like a lifetime of  
         wandering back and forth between scenes, ending them just as  
         they're getting somewhere. Meanwhile, Commander Riker, in a   
         desperate attempt to have something to do with the story, has 
         become leery of the Embassador and his assistant. The tension 
         builds as the ship approaches Clari III, and... who knows what.

JOEL: The principal wants to see you in her office right now.

SERVO: But what did Worf _think_ about that? How did it make him feel?
CROW: Yeah, we got such an insight into Worf's mind earlier, now I
      want to know more!
JOEL: "Worf wondered why Cathaway tensed up, but then his warrior
      training snapped him out of his introspective reverie and he a-
      gain began scanning for those nasty aliens."

JOEL: Yeah, it's hard to blame a person's beath on a direct question.
SERVO: Joel, what's a "beath"?
JOEL: When you're older, honey.

>   "You...you're Immortal..."

CROW: Boy, she's quick on the uptake, isn't she?
SERVO: Yup.

>   "You think all Immortals are cold-blooded killers?

JOEL: No, no-- some of us are more into white-collar crime!

SERVO: The guy who's always hanging around me. The one with the sword.
       Will you pay attention, please?

>   "You remember the picture in my quarters?" 

SERVO: [thick German accent] Yes! I vas the sheep!

[Joel picks Servo up again, and they all leave the theater.]

...o...2...3...4...5...6...G

[SoL bridge. Joel, Crow, and Servo are standing in their usual places.]

CROW: Whew! Eight chapters, and the plot only made a cameo appearance at
      the end!

SERVO: Yeah, but there was something all through this story... something
       ominous. Didn't you feel it?

JOEL: C'mon, there wasn't anything we haven't seen before. One-dimension-
      al characters, bad grammar, worse spelling, scenery that exists on-
      ly for convenience, total rewriting of the history of well-estab-
      lished characters, dumb heroes and dumber villains, everything 
      else-- sure, but we've dealt with all that before.

CROW: Tom's right, Joel. There was a feeling of inescapable doom! It was
      like watching a countdown to my own execution!

SERVO: Yeah! Transporter Room 5...

CROW: Fyla IV...

SERVO: Clari III...

JOEL: John F. Moore, too...

CROW: There can be only one...

[Cambot starts up some music that is a bit cheerier than the mood might
suggest. Tom, Crow, and Joel start singing.]

ALL: We'd like to see them all at ground zero--

SERVO: The blithering sidekick,

JOEL: The smart-aleck hero,

CROW: The Mexican who's after everyone's head--

ALL: We'd like to see them all dead!

JOEL: The ensign who jumps at the sound of her name,

CROW: The alien extras who all talk the same,

SERVO: And ev'ryone else in this flaming cow pie--

ALL: We'd like to see them all die, die, die, die!

CROW: Lock them away where some horrid thing lurks,

SERVO: Shoot them, behead them, whatever will work!

JOEL: Push them off a lighthouse-- what do you think of that?

ALL: We'd like to see them go splat!

SERVO: It isn't a kind thought, but it must be said--

ALL: We'd like to see them all dead!

SERVO: DEAD!

[MSTH set, one more time. "Jack Perkins" is holding an elderly-looking
hardbound book as though he was in the middle of reading it.]

PERKINS: Did you know that quite a few members of royalty have become 
         authors? Queen Marie of Roumania, for instance, not only wrote 
         her own book of fairy tales, [waves book a little bit to call 
         attention to it] but illustrated it herself as well. 

         That's all for tonight, but join us again next time on the Mys-
         tery Science Theater Hour.

[MSTH theme; "Jack Perkins" is standing stock still as always.]

PERKINS: Hello, and welcome once again. Tonight, we present the long-
         awaited continuation of the space adventure "Treklander". 
         You know, when "Treklander" first aired on alt.startrek.
         creative, it received some of the highest and most copious
         praise any story had ever gotten there. Well, we know Joel
         and the robots aren't going to like anything the Mads send
         them-- let's see what they think of it.

[roll theme v1.1]

...o...2...3...4...5...6...G

[SoL bridge; fake greenery is everywhere. The supposed plants and
trees range in quality from "hey, at least it's got style" to "this
wouldn't fool Bert I. Gordon." Joel walks by, carrying a small potted
plant that could almost be mistaken for the real thing at twenty or 
thirty yards, and notices Cambot.]

JOEL: Oh, hi, everyone. Welcome to the Satellite of Love. We're green-
      ing up the ship today for our invention exchange.

[Servo walks-- er, floats in as Joel puts the "plant" down just off-
screen.]

SERVO: Oh, you're finished! It looks really nice.

JOEL: Actually, we've still got to move that big tree into position,
      if you wouldn't mind helping.

SERVO: Uh, I'm still looking for Crow to get him to help.

JOEL: I thought he was looking for you.

CROW: [coming in behind Servo] Is he done yet?

SERVO: Crow!!

JOEL: C'mon, guys, you're helping. [walks off-screen]

SERVO: You were supposed to wait for the all-clear!

CROW: Well, he *looked* done...

[The commercial sign button flashes.]

JOEL: [leaning back into the frame and hitting the button] We'll be
      right back. Now come on, you two.


[It doezn't matter what comez, there will alwayz be death, taxez, and
Clotheztime adz.]


[Joel, Gypsy, Servo, and Crow are maneuvering a reasonable simulation
of an evergreen into place beside the big "G" door.]

JOEL: ...okay, there. All right.

[All step back to look at it. The Mads lights flash.]

JOEL: Oh, just in time-- Fry and Laurie are calling. [hits button]

[Deep 13]

[Deep 13 has also had a plant invasion. Several real, if ill-tended,
plants are drooping over the various consoles. Dr. Forrester is push-
ing a half-barrel-sized planter with a bush in it across the floor.]

DR. F: Ah-- the Cambrian Explosion is here, Frank! You go first with
       the invention exchange, Joel, we're still setting up for ours.

[SoL]

[Joel and the 'bots are wearing model dinosaur heads and necks that
seem to be coming out of the tops of their heads. Crow has a tricera-
tops head, Gypsy has a tyrannosaur, Joel has a maiasaur, and Servo's
headgear is the top of an iguanadon.]

JOEL: Well, sirs, our invention exchange this week is based on Larry
      Gonick's book _The Cartoon Guide to (Non)Communication_.

[The maiasaur head speaks in a voice similar to Joel's, if Joel were
in the process of being strangled.]

MAIASAUR: I loathe you! I despise you!

JOEL: Some scientists believe that emotions first evolved in the time
      of the dinosaurs. In essence, all our feelings are messages from
      an "inner dinosaur" buried in our brains.

SERVO: I thought you humans didn't evolve from dinosaurs.

MAIASAUR: Oh, *duh*!

JOEL: [to Servo] Shh, not now.

SERVO: Anyway, we've taken Gonick's graphic representation one step
       further. Now you can let the world know how you really feel
       without the inconvenience of having to do it yourself.

CROW: Hey, Joel, mine isn't doing anything!

MAIASAUR: Geez, you gotta explain *everything* to 'em!

JOEL: [patiently] That's because you're a robot, Crow. You don't have an
      inner dinosaur.

CROW: Aw, what a gyp.

[Deep 13]

[Frank, wearing a pakycephalosaur head, is being attacked by Forres-
ter, who is wielding the model head and neck of a diplodocus.  Forres-
ter glances at the camera, then shoves the diplodocus head at Frank,
who stumbles back.]

DR. F: Your experiment today is the continuation of John F. Moore's
       train wreck of a fanfic, "Treklander". Choke on it, C. Arthur
       Toon.

FRANK: [stumbling forward now] Why don't they look? Tell me... [col-
       lapses on the console]

DR. F: Frank, have you been into the deathangel again?

[SoL]

SERVO: Terse today, aren't they?

MAIASAUR: [to Gypsy] Hey hey *hey*! Your swamp or mine?

[The tyrannosaur head emits a deep, menacing growl.]

[Alarms sound, lights flash, etc.]

EVERYONE AND THEIR DINOSAURS: Aaaaa! We got message sign!

G...6...5...4...3...2...o...

heads.]

      a comma when the feeling's not as strong.
      So when you're happy--

       been hit by one of those nasty Kling-free torpedoes. Now, roll
       to the left-- mm-hmm, now right-- beautiful, beautiful, now grip
       those instruments!
JOEL: [putting his hand on Servo's shoulder] Okay, I think that's e-
      nough.

CROW: Free? 10,000 credits, that's my final offer!

JOEL: Riker's been polishing up his Snappy Retorts to Silly People.

CROW: What's that got to do with anything?
JOEL: How about his word as a badly written stereotype?

CROW: You could stun everyone in the room and sort 'em out at your lei-

CROW: [as Picard] Mr. Data, signal the pursuing vessel that, as usual,

[SoL bridge, as green as ever. Joel is holding a small bag of some-
thing.]

CROW: All right, so how does John F. Moore come up with those weird ali-
      en names?

JOEL: Well, he could be using any one of a number of proven techniques.
      For instance, one of the most common is pulling letters out of
      [shakes bag] a Scrabble bag. Want to try?

CROW: Sure, okay.

JOEL: Okay, let's see... [rummages around in bag, pulls out letter] Q.

SERVO: <heh> Hey, it works!

JOEL: I think we could get sued for that one, though. [tosses letter
      offscreen, pulls another out of bag] W. Oh, how many letters do
      you want?

CROW: Something short, so the hapless victims could scream it quickly...
      yet distinctive, so it haunts the mind.

JOEL: Okay. [pulling letters out of bag and putting them on the coun-
      ter] H, A, T, D, O--

SERVO: [laughing] "Hat do"? Isn't that when you wear a fez, and it mes-
       ses up your hair?

CROW: Hey!

JOEL: [still pulling letters out of bag] Y, O. That enough?

CROW: "Hatdoyo". Uh, I dunno.

JOEL: [to Servo] Here, you take a turn. Say when.

SERVO: Okay... [Joel pulls out five letters] ...when. [examining let-
       ters] "Ugetw".

JOEL: There, that's a good one.

CROW: No, no, it just doesn't have that box-office ring to it.  Here,
      let me try again. [Joel pulls out more letters] When!

SERVO: "Henyo". That could be "Hatdoyo"'s brother.

JOEL: I think that sounds like one of those giant rubber monsters. You
      know, like Rodan, Gaigan, Gamera-- [both 'bots come as close as
      they can to wincing] --oh, sorry, guys. Okay... [pulls four more
      letters out of the bag]

CROW: "Umul". [pronounces it "a mule"]

SERVO: Isaac Asimov already used that one.

JOEL: Yeah. [pulls a bunch more letters out] "Tiplysi".

SERVO: Isn't that the capital of Soviet Georgia?

CROW: Joel, are you sure real writers do this?

JOEL: That's *formerly* Soviet Georgia, and yes, lots of writers do
      this.

CROW: Which ones?

JOEL: Oh, lots of them.

SERVO: You don't know, do you?

CROW: You're just making this up, aren't you?

JOEL: [in a tone of parental authority] That is beside the point; now
      could we get on with the exercise?

SERVO: [sotto voce, to Crow] He doesn't know. [Joel looks at him] Uh,
       four letters.

JOEL: Right. [shoves previous letter tiles out of the way, pulls out
      four more letters] X, B, Y, N.

CROW: Oh, that's one of those enigmatic energy beings that knows every-
      thing and goes and tests humanity to make sure it's worthy.

SERVO: Worthy of what, they never say.

JOEL: Well, try this one. [yup, he pulls more letters out of the bag] I,
      N, E-- oh, there aren't any more. [the commercial light flashes]
      And we got commercial sign. We'll be right back.

SERVO: I still say John F. Moore hits his head against the keyboard.

JOEL: Where'd that Q go?

CROW: I think it fell in the privet bush.

[Come and see the 61% Old Tour, now playing at a metropolis near you!]


[Deep 13, and no one's home. A bewildered young man happens by. He's
wearing tennis shoes, a T-shirt with a dragon on it, a nose ring, and
jeans that must have seen many trials and tribulations. He is holding a
ragged piece of paper, and carrying a cardboard sword.]

GAMER: [looking nowhere in particular] Hey, Rob! You in here?

[TV's Frank walks in, still wearing the pakycephalosaur head, although
it appears to have been switched off.]

FRANK: What are you doing here? How'd you get in?

[The young man is startled, but quickly recovers and dramatically
swings his sword at Frank, giving him a moderate tap on the shoul-
der.]

GAMER: Ha! I smite you with my +8 Sword of Munchkins!

FRANK: We don't want any. Why don't you try the lab down the block?

GAMER: [tapping Frank in the shoulder and neck ar-- er, region as if to
       prove a point] You're dead.

FRANK: I am not dead.

GAMER: Yeah, you are. I just hit you with my +8 Sword of Munchkins.

FRANK: Look, I have been dead several times, and I know I'm not dead
       now. So if you would please *leave*... [indicates the way out,
       but the gamer tries to go the other way]

GAMER: Uh, I came in that way.

[Frank pauses, making some mental adjustment.]

FRANK: You came in through the steam tunnels?

GAMER: Yeah, the Caves of Depression...

[Frank has already run off. The gamer looks alert and ready to hit some-
thing, but can't figure out what to do. Frank speedily returns with Dr.
Forrester, who is wearing the model diplodocus section, switched off, on
his head.]

GAMER: Isn't this supposed to be the Temple of the Broken Shield?

DR. F: [in an extraordinarily cheerful manner that makes it plain some-
       thing unspeakably evil is about to happen] Of *course* it is! 
       [begins leading the gamer away] Now, I have some vital informa-
       tion about the... what was it again...

GAMER: The Ring of Total Fish Annihilation?

DR. F: Exactly. Just make yourself comfortable over here... [glances
       back at Frank, and speaks quietly] You know the drill, Frank.

FRANK: Third drawer from the top, the... green syringe.

DR. F: Right. And switch the visuals back to the satellite.

[Frank hustles over to the console.]

[SoL]

[The fake plants and tree have been decorated with itty-bitty white
lights and life-size plastic cherries. Posters depicting various super-
heroes cover most of what would be visible of the walls behind the
greenery. Gypsy is wearing a bowl of fruit on her head. Joel is attired
in his "Feet of Fate" robe from _"Manos"_ and a long, multicolored scarf
similar to the one worn by the Fourth Doctor. There is a bunch of silver
glitter in his hair. Servo has on a grass skirt, a pink Spandex top, and
an English judicial wig, and there are two plastic fish in his head.
Crow, a Spock ear attached to each side of his head, is hanging by his
mouth from a trapeze. Two dozen paper cocktail umbrellas are suspended
from the ceiling at various heights. Breath mints are EVERYWHERE. On the
counter, there is an electric guitar and a gallon of milk.]

JOEL: You mean we weren't on the air at all?

CROW: Mmmph mrrgmf!

GYPSY: Aww.

SERVO: Geez.

[Alarms go off and lights flash; Crow's trapeze starts swinging wildly.]

JOEL & SERVO: Oh no! Message sign!

CROW: MMGMMMMMRFMMMLGMF!

[The picture freezes as Joel is hitting the button, and fades to the
MSTH set. There are several British Museum plastic dinosaurs on the col-
umn next to Perkins.]

PERKINS: Much like the dinosaurs, the Star Trek universe was once
         thought to be primitive and outmoded, but has been shown to
         have more potential for adaptation than people first thought.
         "Treklander" is only one of the thousands of species of cross-
         overs that have evolved from it. Join us for the conclusion on
         the next Mystery Science Theater Hour.

[The lights dim, the theme starts, and Perkins turns to his plastic di-
nosaur collection. He appears to simulating a fight between them.]

tunately, he starts moving when the theme ends.]

PERKINS: Hello. Welcome once again. Tonight, we at last see the end of
         "Treklander". Or is it?
         "Embassador Duncan MacLoud" is on a peacekeeping mission on the
         planet Clari III. Meanwhile, in a completely different story,
         his arch-enemy, Sancho Marin, is commanding a ship full of
         Clarians in a pitched battle with the Enterprise. On the Enter-
         prise, Captain Picard and Commander Riker have been knocked
         out, leaving Data to command the ship. He gives orders for the
         ship to split up, sending the saucer section out of the story.
         Will Marin and his unnamed ship get the better of Data and half
         the Enterprise? Will "MacLoud" ever have a meaningful relation-
         ship with his girlfriend, Ensign Cathaway? And will we be trea-
         ted to any more flashbacks to the Alamo? Stay tuned!

GYPSY: Because I need to do some maintenance.

CROW: Why?

GYPSY: Because Joel programmed me to.

CROW: Hey, it *is* Hole in the Wall!

SERVO: Yeah, life sucks, kid. Get used to it.

JOEL: [falsetto] Hmm... they're fighting... I can't decide which one
      looks dreamier... what's this? I've drawn my phaser!

SERVO: This story's broken all the laws of narrative and physics-- I
       guess Paul's Law was the only thing left.
CROW: Hey, at least we've got an action scene.

JOEL: [mechanically] No. Stop. Don't do it.

SERVO: BAD right hand! Don't do that!

> The phaser blast

CROW: Okay, okay, wait juuuuuuuuuust a minute! First Marin says he'll
      destroy Duncan by shooting him with the phaser, and then Julia
      shoots *him* but he's just fine? What's the deal?
SERVO: [exasperated] Crow, you want narrative consistency at *this*
       stage?

> and watched the battle from above.

JOEL: Phaser blasts have eyes?
SERVO: Joel, it's pointless arguing any more.

JOEL: [space radio voice] Ah, Houston, we have a negative on that
      flashback separation.

CROW: What *with*?

CROW: Oh, come on, don't trash DS9, too!
SERVO: Fanboy.
CROW: Am not.
JOEL: This is your last warning, guys.

JOEL: In a wacky new sitcom from ABC!

>   "Well, I want to thank you for all your help, Captain," Duncan said.

CROW: [apopleptic] Help? *Help*? Captain Pick-a-card there was out with
      a concussion for the last five chapters and the one before that,
      he let Duncan's mortal enemy escape and cripple the Enterprise! I
      can't *believe* this!
JOEL: "Help" as in, without Picard's help they might have defeated Marin
      for good and closed up the storyline.
CROW: So he was really helping the author?
JOEL: You got it.

JOEL: She can always quiet a room when she enters.
CROW: [as Richie] Oh, man, she's gonna tell!

>   "I should've known I couldn't leave quietly," Richie smirked.
>   "Don't flatter yourself, kid," Guinan said flatly,

SERVO: Hey, Guinan Swifties!
CROW: Huh?

> "I'm here to say 
> goodbye to Julia."
>   Julia and Guinan embraced each other.

CROW: Wrong newsgroup.

>   "Take care of the ship, Guinan," Julia whispered.
>   "And don't you lose your head over MacLeod," Guinan warned Julia.

JOEL: Ha, ha, a little Immortal humor there.

>   The trio stepped onto the transporter pad.
>   "Energize," Duncan said,

CROW: [as Picard] Hey, that's *my* line!

> and with a shimmer of light, they were

SERVO: Hey, wait a minute, was that "Energize or "Atomize"? I think I
       pushed the wrong, uh, thingie... heh...
CROW: We only wish.
JOEL: Come on, you guys. Let's clear out of here while we still can.
      [moves to pick up Servo]
CROW: I wanna stay and watch the sig block.
JOEL: Oh, all right. [settles down again]

[Servo and Crow wear the closest thing to jubilant expressions that they
can manage. Joel walks in, carrying a plate of turkey.]

SERVO: Hey, what's this?

JOEL: Since we've made it all the way through "Treklander", I thought a
      little thanksgiving celebration would be in order.

SERVO & CROW: Yeah! All right!

CROW: Lemme go first! I want to go first. I give thanks because "Trek-
      lander" is finally over!

SERVO: Oh, you took the easy one.

CROW: Yes, the nightmare is at an end! Wooo-hooo!

JOEL: Yes!

SERVO: I give thanks because John F. Moore finally got a spellchecker.
       He even figured out how to spell the names of the characters he
       was stealing!

JOEL: Right on!

CROW: Yessss!

JOEL: I give thanks because... uh... he changed the quote in his sig
      block!

CROW: Well...

SERVO: Actually, I looked forward to seeing the same quotation, as the
       only constant in the erratic mishmash that was "Treklander".

JOEL: Well... nothing else really got better toward the end.

SERVO: True.

JOEL: Come on, as bad as it was, at least it's over with. We won't be
      hearing from Sancho Marin for quite a while.

[WHAM! On top of his last line, the ship shakes violently.]

CROW: Don't be too sure!

SERVO: Why do I suddenly feel like doing a Red Cross spot?

JOEL: [with feeling] Oh, of all the times for contrived plot construc-
      tion to rear its ugly head! Cambot, give me Rocket Number Nine!

[Cut to exterior SoL. One of the Klingon warbirds from Original Trek
has pulled up to the SoL and is firing phasers at it. The shots are
glancing off an energy shield. Cut to interior SoL.]

CROW: [surprised] Gee, this experiment got *expensive* all of a sudden.

SERVO: There's something coming in on the hexfield.

JOEL: Open hailing frequencies!

[The hexfield opens up to reveal... Sancho Marin, grinning evilly!]

SERVO: Oh, no! It's Sancho Marin, the villain from today's experiment!

CROW: Thank you, Ensign Exposition.

MARIN: Well, sinor McCloud. Once again we meet for the first time for
       the last time.

JOEL: Look, there's some mistake. We're not Duncan MacLeod.

MARIN: Don't try to geeve me that "We're not Duncan MacLeod" story, ami-
       gos! Apollo 13 said "We're not Duncan MacLeod." The _Liberator_
       said "We're not Duncan MacLeod." Babylon 4 said "We're not Duncan
       MacLeod." Every time, he was aboard!

[Joel, Crow, and Servo look at each other, consternated.]

MARIN: And every time he gave me the sleep! But thees time you weel not
       get away! Seence you are trapped and cannot escape my eventual
       revenge, I'm going to let you tweest in the weend for now, ami-
       gos. But I'll be back in the sequel. Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[The hexfield closes.]

CROW: I wonder what *he* wanted.

SERVO: I wonder what he meant about a sequel.

JOEL: [mugging to the camera] Well, Tom, Crow, let's just hope that it
      was just an empty threat. Grid willing, there will *never* be a
      "Treklander II". Well, what do you think, sirs?

[Deep 13]

[Frank is still wearing the pakycephalosaur head; Dr. Forrester is
wearing the diplodocus head and neck on his head. Dr. F breaks into
evil laughter.]

DIPLODOCUS: [in a strangled Dr. F voice] Push the button, Frank.

[Frank shrugs meekly and reaches for the button.]

PAKYCEPHALOSAUR: [in a suprisingly normal-sounding Frank voice] Why me?
                 How come you can't push the button, huh? I mean, just
                 once...  [continues in a similar vein as...]

[Fade to MSTH set, where there are no extra props visible.]

PERKINS: Oh, little do they know-- well, I shouldn't spoil the surprise,
         but tune in next time for the Mystery Science Theater Hour.

[Lights down; Perkins relaxes a little and leans on the column.]
