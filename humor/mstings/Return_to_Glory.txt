AUTHOR'S NOTE: There are a number of riffs in this MSTing that take on 
an additional layer of double meaning or irony "thanks to" the release
of Mr. Ratliff's pornfic involving Wesley Crusher and Marrissa. The
Return to Glory riffing was done almost entirely before The Horror
existed, but the new, suddenly "interesting" riffs are being left in
because, well, they're even funnier now. Enjoy!

[Season 10 Theme]

SOL Bridge. The bots are, as they are wont to do, having a lovely
conversation of some sort...

TOM:   Crow, you'd better start thinking about your career.
CROW:  Well you'd better start thinking about yours!
TOM:   No, I'm pretty sure that it's -you- who'd better start thinking
       about -yours-.
CROW:  I've done some research into the matter, Tom, and I've discovered
       that you'd better be thinking about yours.
TOM:   Maybe I'm thinking of Gypsy. Maybe she'd better start thinking
       about hers?
[Mike enters, tossing a ball in a catcher's mitt]
MIKE:  Hey, Crow, I found your catcher's mitt.
CROW:  Yeah? Well you'd better start thinking about yours!
MIKE:  I don't have a catcher's mitt.
CROW:  Still... you'd better! Start thinking! About yours!
TOM:   Maybe it's the Nanites. Perhaps they'd better start thinking
       about theirs?
MIKE:  I think you guys have got your Travolton levels up way too high.
       Lemme hook you up to the e-meter and see. We'll be right back.

[Commercial Sign]

MIKE:  There. That oughta clear out those engrams. Hey, Nicole Kidman and
       Tom Cruise are calling.

[Castle Forrester, alternating shots with the SOL bridge. We're all 
 familiar with the drill by now, right? Right.]

PEARL: Ah, Nelsciento. Prepare for ultimate pain. Prepare for agony the
       likes of which this world has never seen. Prepare for... Stephen
       Ratliff's latest Marrissa Story! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

[Thunder crashes, wolves howl, ominous organ chords play.]

CROW:  And...
TOM:   We're supposed to be concerned because...
PEARL: It's a new Marrissa Story! From Stephen Ratliff! Muahahaha?

[As before, only about half as much. It was on 8 before, and we need it
 at about 4 now. Thanks. You're a doll.]

MIKE:  But it's not Dr. Thinker or anything.
CROW:  Yeah, after the Doc, and those godawful Buffy stories, getting
       back to some nice, wholesome, predictable Ratliff seems like a nice
       change of pace!
TOM:   Wait. This isn't the porn one, right?
PEARL: There's a porn one?
CROW:  Tom! Shut up!
PEARL: Perhaps for another day. No, this isn't the porn one. This is just
       a dip into pregnancy, negotiations, sibling rivalry, space battles,
       and persecution of the overweight entitled "Return to Glory". And
       try to pretend it hurts, just a little?
MIEK:  We've got Ratliff sign!

>A Marrissa Story 
>By Stephen Ratliff

MIKE:  So, is this a Marrissa Story?

>Start date: Jan 3, 1996
>Completion date: July 13, 1998

TOM:   This took two and a half years to finish? Man, if there were some 
       peculiar, omnipotent being controlling our very words and thoughts, 
       I bet he wouldn't feel so bad about how long it, theoretically, 
       would have taken him to make fun of Stevo's little story here.

>Prologue
>
>     Once Marrissa Picard became Commanding Admiral Star Fleet, 

MIKE:  All hope was lost. Our only chance was to defect to the Cardassians 
       before it was too late.

>                                                                the
>Last Romulan War moved into a stage of even advantages.  Generally
>such times are the least likely times for others to chose sides.

TOM:   However, the second paragraph of a Ratliff story is the most likely 
       place for the first tense problem to occur.

>                                                                 But
>even when all things are equal, the potential for something or someone
>to chose sides and tip the balance remains.  

CROW:  Is balance-tipping anything like cow tipping. Mike?

>     For the Last Romulan War, it was the Klingons.

CROW:  Klingons are master cow-tippers. They consider it a warrior's 
       pastime.

>                                                     The Klingons
>don't often stay out of wars, this one was no different.  The question
>was which side would they come in on.

MIKE:  And would they bring a foreign object into the ring?

>                                       While the Klingons had been
>friendly with the Federation for quite some time, 

TOM:   The Federation wasn't comfortable going beyond heavy petting.

>                                                  there was a belief
>that there was too much contact between the two and something counter
>balance that was needed.  

TOM:   You know, after all these years, and all these fanfics, there's 
       something strangely... comforting about that sentence.
CROW:  Yeah, like coming home after a long trip, finding your apartment 
       broken into, but realizing the crooks left your Genesis CD's 
       untouched.

>                         That belief made the chances of the
>Federation receiving aid from the Klingon Empire harder.  
>     But the Romulan Star Empire had an even lesser chance of aid. 

MIKE:  They always practiced "safe treks"

>Being historical enemies to the Klingons did not bode well for the
>Romulans.  That had been overcome before though, the relationship with
>the house of Duras being a prime example.  

TOM:   A prime example of mildly interesting political intrigue, unlike 
       what you are about to read.

>     Whichever side the Klingons joined would win.  That was a near
>certainty.  It only remained to see which side would return the
>Klingons to the glory of battle.

CROW:  However, it would be Peter Cetera who would ultimately teach the 
       Klingons about the glory of love.

>
>Professor John P. Hereomise III
>Chair, Department of History, 
>University of Essex.

CROW:  In the future, even furniture will have college degrees!

>Chapter One
>
>     He once was known as Kern, son of Mog.  

TOM:   Half man, half dog?

>                                            Now he was leader of the
>Klingon High Council.  

MIKE:  They wake and bake every morning! Woooo!

>                      It was a quark of fate that he was chosen to
>lead the Empire some eight years before.  

CROW:  Quark of fate?
TOM:   Well, he does run a casino.

>                                         Doctor Bashir had tried to
>wipe his memories so he could live with honor after the House of Mog
>was thrown out of the Empire.  

MIKE:  [Bashir] Take two bottles of tequila and call me in the morning.

>                              It had worked, for a while.  Then when
>Marrissa Picard had come to arbitrate the succession after the
>unexpected death of Gowron, he'd remembered.

TOM:   So, Marrissa is medically equivalent to a good whack on the head?
CROW:  Seems right to me.

>                                             It was another of the
>Klingon body's famous redundancies.

CROW:  I present to you... a Klingon with five asses!

>     He'd brought his brother's house back into the Empire again. 

TOM:   The House of Mogh must be a double-wide.

>Worf's valor in battle had helped.  As for Alexander, well as a
>warrior he was a failure, as a good luck charm he'd had better luck,
>and as a diplomat, well he had the best record of any Klingon
>Ambassador.

MIKE:  And as a woman, he was positively scrumptious!

>            Today, however, would be different.  Kern could not speak
>for his family today, well except to show pictures of his new
>grandniece.  That was understandable, 

CROW:  To everyone except the readers...

>                                      and since Kern had no child of
>his own, and was of an age to be a grandparent, this was expected,
>even among Klingon warriors.  Sit a group of old Klingon warriors in a
>room and watch the pictures of there hopeful little warrior
>grandchildren come out.  

MIKE:  This ritual is called "k'mpagh 'Arh", the "circle jerk".

>                        When Kern was younger, he'd thought it was
>disgusting behavior for a warrior to be fawning over pictures of
>cutely dressed young children.

TOM:   The Klingon equivalent of the FBI, however, objected to his 
       alternative, and confiscated Kern's computer.

>     An aid interrupted his reminiscing, "Chancellor Kern, the Council
>is waiting."
>     He grunted his acknowledgment and turned toward the council
>chambers.

ALL:   [singing] To everything, turn, Kern, turn...

>          Today was the day the representatives of the Romulans and
>the Federation would arrive.  Soon the Empire would war with one of
>them along side the other.  

MIKE:  [gruff] Commas and clear referents are not the way of a true 
       Klingon warrior!

>                           He hoped he would not have to fight his
>brother, or attack little Alexis Rozhenko's home.

CROW:  'Cause he knew Alexis would kick his scaly Klingon butt.

>Four days earlier

MIKE:  This story has become... unstuck in time!

>
>     Captain Jay Gordon, was not in the best mood.  He'd just heard
>that his wife was planning to go on another dangerous mission.  

TOM:   Worse, she was planning to return!

>                                                                She
>was in command of Star Fleet.  She wasn't supposed to be running into
>danger.  

CROW:  Harvey Danger?
MIKE:  Dirk Dangerous?
TOM:   Dangermouse?

>        As he entered his wife's ready room, she looked up from her
>seat.  

MIKE:  Those new rectal-ocular implants were coming in very handy.

>        Normally Marrrissa would have gotten up when he entered like
>this and pace while trying to explain herself.  

CROW:  But, you know, she was still sore from the implants.

>                                               Normally she wasn't
>eight and a half months pregnant.

TOM:   Still, given Marrissa's apparent attitude toward's contraception, I 
       wouldn't be surprised if it was all that abnormal either.

>     "You are not running off on some foolish mission to the Klingon
>Empire," he said, standing in front of his wife's desk, his hands
>braced on its front edge.

CROW:  Jay, subconsciously acknowledging his intellectual inferiority, adopts one of Brak's poses.

>     "Oh," Marrissa said, sorting out the PADDs on her desk.

CROW:  Wait. She's eight months pregnant. Why would she need... oh. 
       Nevermind.
MIKE:  [chuckling] New Stargazers with wings?

>     "You are commanding Star Fleet," Jay responded.  "You can't be
>running around tending to every little detail."

TOM:   Crushing every little peasant uprising...

>     "The High Council's debate on which side they will enter the war
>on is hardly a little detail," Marrissa replied.  "They've got the
>third largest fleet in the Quadrant.  

MIKE:  Here's a little tip, Marrissa.  Never let your husband know that 
       you're well-acquainted with the size of Klingon "fleets".

>                                     Their entry into the war could
>tip the balance either way."
>     "Surely you can send someone else," Jay stated.

CROW:  Look, Jay. I'm in charge here. You're not. And call me Shirley 
       again and it's off to Rura Pente with you.

>     "They're aren't that many people in the fleet that command
>respect with Klingons," Marrissa began.  

TOM:   And most of those are in the musical theater.

>                                        "My father, who is still
>recovering from injuries; Alexander and Worf don't have enough rank to
>make an impression; 

CROW:  You kuow how Klingons make a good impression, don't you? They use 
       their heads! Heh.
TOM:   Kill him.

>                    and Rear Admiral Zaxdorn who spent the last four
>year heading our joint training program died yesterday."

CROW:  [Marrissa] And before you even ask, little mister, I was parsecs 
       away when it happened.

>     "Send Alex, he's more available than you are," Jay replied. 
>"You're due in two weeks."

TOM:   So, Marrissa is Jay's senior research project?
MIKE:  It'd explain a lot, wouldn't it?

>     "I though this was your professional objections," Marrissa said,
>easing herself up from her chair.  She walked around the desk to stand
>beside her husband.  "I have to do this Jay.  

CROW:  [Marrissa] Of all the Jays in the Federation, this is the one I 
       have to do.

>                                             This is one case where
>no one else can do it for me."
>     "I know," Jay responded, knowing from her bearing that this was a
>lost cause and now attempting to reduce the danger.  

TOM:   Having attempted, no matter how ineffectually, to thwart Marrissa's 
       wishes, Jay prepared himself for the inevitable reprisal.

>                                                    "I just hate to
>see you go off into trouble."  He embraced his wife, pulling her close
>as her belly would allow.

MIKE:  Honey, are you sure you're really "eating for five"?

>     "Who says you aren't coming with me?" Marrissa returned. 

TOM:   [Jay] Um, that was you, on our wedding night, wasn't it?

>     "Well we can't afford to take a Nova Class starship off the line. 
>I've seen the reports," Jay said.
>     "And that keeps you from joining me?"

MIKE:  Well, that plus raw cowardice.

>     "Well someone has to command the Enterprise.  Clara certainly
>can't.  Alexis hasn't let her sleep since she was born last week.

TOM:   This Kids Crew is getting out of hand.  Now Marrissa's considering 
       putting a newborn in charge!

>                                                                  And
>Alex isn't in much better shape."
>     "I've got that taken care of," Marrissa smiled.

CROW:  The new Kids Crew Fat Farm is fully operational.

>
>     Deep in Engineering, down under the port plasma transfer conduit,
>a terminal was being used, as it never had been intended to. 

ALL:   [clear throats uncomfortably]

>                                                             Its user

>screen towards a destination that no crewmember should have sent
>anything other than phaser bolts.

MIKE:  Ah, the Wisconsin Dells.

>
>     Jacqueline Marie Picard was working at the computer terminal in
>the room she shared with her sister's sister-in-law.  

TOM:   Little sister's sister-in-law, don't you do what your big sister's 
       sister-in-law doessssss...

>                                                     She'd
>technically been off shift for hours, but that never stopped her from
>improving the Enterprise Computer's defenses.

CROW:  Now, the Enterprise's computers spray a foul-smelling liquid from 
       their back end when threatened.

>     It was a good thing the Computer Security Officer had been at
>work.  If she hadn't been, the security breach might not have been
>caught.  As Jackie watched and recorded, the intruder patched up all
>the evidence that they had been into the classified data.

MIKE:  She thought about doing something about it, but technically, she 
       was off duty.

>                                                           She'd
>initiated a trace the moment she'd discovered it, but it wasn't until
>two minutes after the hacker logged off that she'd figured out where
>they had been working.

TOM:   They're contacting the Wisconsin Dells! They must be stopped!

>     A call to Lieutenant Sachs had sent a security team to
>investigate, but Jackie knew it was too late.  It only remained for
>her to inform the Captain.

MIKE:  And receive her duly meted out punishment.

>                           Her big sister was not going to like this. 
>And it meant that Jackie would be unable to accompany her to Kronos. 

TOM:   Jackie was a big fan of classical quartets.

>Jackie had been looking forward to it for the past couple days, but
>now she had something important she had to do.
>
>     Admiral Saavik Jeric entered the bridge of her new ship, her

CROW:  That's a pretty unwieldy name for a ship.
TOM:   Maybe it's a lot shorter in Romulan.

>                                        The Bloodfire was the second
>Warhawk class starship the Romulans had produced.

MIKE:  Warhawk II: Bloodfire. Coming to Playstation this Christmas.

>                                                   It was just
>completed, and Saavik wanted to take it right out into battle.

CROW:  She was gonna take out Kirstie Alley once and for all!
MIKE:  This isn't that Saavik, Crow. I think it's an hommage.
TOM:   An hommage du frommage, if you will.

>                                                               The
>Warhawk had some success already, but an encounter with the Nova and
>the Yorktown had forced it to retire from the front for repairs. 

TOM:   But it did get a lovely gold chronometer from the rest of the 
       fleet.

>Apparently, Admiral Pasek did not know when to chose his battles.  He
>did know when to save his own skin at least.  

CROW:  He did not know when to hold them, but he did know when to fold 
       them.

>     Saavik had studied the martial history of her enemies, especially
>that of the Enterprise.  She wasn't alone in doing this.

TOM:   Her and her friends started a spunky club, even.

>                                                         The Romulan

MIKE:  Oh, great. On top of gverything else, Marrissa's become curriculum!

>                                      Saavik, however, went further.  
>She studied back to the naval vessels Enterprise.  But it wasn't the 
>Enterprise that she though her counterparts should have studied.  It 
>was the USS Constitution, a ship still moored in Boston harbor.

CROW:  By studying the tactics of stationary, retired, ancient floating 
       vessels, Saavik would provide Marrissa with the easy victory that
       is her due.

>                                                                 The

MIKE:  In this case, that'd be "refuge hiding in your home port".

TOM:   I mean, look at the way he was dressed!

>every once in a while, but not when each of the two starships alone
>was of equal strength to the one.

TOM:   So, the fleets of the many outweigh the fleets of the two?
CROW:  Or the one.

>                                  Saavik didn't care if the Captains
>of the two ships where of lesser quality.  They'd made it to command

CROW:  They were movin' on up, to that deluxe starship in the sky.

>                                               They could handle

>request of the Praetor; who had no real knowledge of what it took to

MIKE:  You know, using semicolons like that is illegal in 49 states.
CROW:  [John Henson] Sorry, Virginia!

>                If she hadn't been the Praetor's youngest sister, she
>wouldn't have been in this post either, but the difference was that
>she could command.

TOM:   If an infinite number of nepotists hire an infinite number of 
       relatives, eventually, one of them will be Shakespeare.

>     The Bridge of the Bloodfire was larger than that of her last
>command.  In some ways it reminder her of pictures of the Federation's
>Galaxy Class starship bridge.  

CROW:  Thereby putting the minimum load on the reader's imagination.

>                              The command chair was a high-backed
>chair that could face any part of the bridge.   It was done in dark

>cue from that chair.

MIKE:  Leading into a show-stopping musical number!

>                    The other chairs were shorter, but adorned in
>the same manner.  The bridge rails were green marble, and the
>traditional warbird crest was inlaid by the turbolift in the same

TOM:   Any questions about other intricate details of Romulan interior 
       decorating can be mailed directly to Stephen.

>Saavik announced.  "I serve the Empire, and this vessel is mine.  Is

>     The bridge crew replied, "Jolan true."

MIKE:  Which is a Romulan phrase meaning "humor the Captain".

>     "Then I will expect your loyalty until death parts us," Saavik
>concluded. "Bridge Officer, our orders please."

CROW:  OK, who had the plomeek soup?

>     A Commander that Saavik identified as Sanok, approached with an

TOM:   The Romulans have quite the green marble fetish, don't they?
CROW:  Well, it sets off their eyes so nicely.

TOM:   By hooking this turbine to the coffins of Strunk and White, we're 
       now able to power Cleveland with this sentence.

TOM:   At this rate, Marrissa should be going through the "Captain Kirk 
       Desk Job Crisis" around age 29.

CROW:  And the body count rises...
MIKE:  Maybe "shoot first and ask questions later" isn't the best way to 
       conduct an espionage investigation.

CROW:  How cold -is- it on the bridge?
MIKE:  That's Sulu's daughter, Crow. Show a little respect.

>     "I'm promoting you as of now," Admiral Marrissa Picard said.

MIKE:  As the daughter of a famous, on-screen character, rapid promotion 
       is your God-given right.

>Enterprise and Commander of the First Fleet."
>     "Why?"

TOM:   We're going to tell them that Romulans have cooties.

MIKE:  Yep. Just knowing Marrissa's gone will make the entire Romulan 
       fleet all higgledy-piggledy.

MIKE:  Ceiling, ceiling, on the wall...

       lumps.

MIKE:  She shook 'em like an Etch-A-Sketch.

CROW:  How do you expect them to play Tempest without a paddle?

>     "All the more reason to restrict it," the girl responded.

MIKE:  We learned that Jay still sleeps with his woobie, sir.

>     "Do we still have the originals I may need them," Sulu said.

TOM:   In case I feel like leading the fleet into a Romulan ambush, just 
       for kicks.
 
>Jackie nodded.  "Good, how much have you narrowed down the suspects
>too."
>     "We've got it down to 200 officers, sir," O'Brien said. 

CROW:  Which is odd, since our crew complement is only 175.

MIKE:  So we just had all 200 shot.

MIKE:  [Jackie, muttering] Even though its a stupid idea, stupidhead.

[Door Sequence]

SOL Bridge. Servo and Crow are struggling in the center of the desk, 
pushing against each other. Neither appears to be making much headway.
Mike enters from offscreen, munching on a bag of chips.

CROW:  Ah, Mike is here! Ugh! Let's take a break.
TOM:   OK... [bots stop struggling]
MIKE:  What's goin' on?
CROW:  You see, Tom and I have moved into a stage of even advantages.
TOM:   Yep, pretty much. The First Robot War is at a stalemate.
MIKE:  When did you declare war on each other?
TOM:   Just after lunch. I think Crow assassinated my archduke or 
       something. Anyway, that's not important.
CROW:  Right. You see, even when all things are equal, the potential 
       for something... or SOMEONE, wink wink, to choose sides and tip the
       balance remains.
TOM:   Exactly. The question is, which side will you come in on?
MIKE:  Me? Why do I have to get involved?
CROW:  Isn't it obvious? The humans are a great warrior race, full of
       bloodlust! You could no more resist a war than, say, I could 
       resist a Kim Catrall spread in Playboy.
TOM:   I don't think you should choose Crow, Mike. I think there's been
       too much contact between the two of you, and something to counter-
       balance that is needed.
CROW:  Yes, but you and Tom are historical enemies!
MIKE:  No, we're not!
CROW:  Didn't he whup your hinder at Scrabble last night?
MIKE:  Hmm... you have a point...
TOM:   Look, Mike. Whichever side you join will win. It's a near-
       certainty. It only remains to see which of us will return you
       to the glory of battle.
MIKE:  Maybe later, guys. I'm kind of full from lunch and these chips.
       And anyway, WE'VE GOT MARRISSA SIIIIIIGN!

[Door Sequence]

TOM:   I hate even advantages.
MIKE:  Hush. The story's starting up again. So. Saavik was related to the 
       Praetor...

MIKE:  Great. Jay manages to pants the one Klingon who finds underwear 
       "too restricting".

       from a matter of honor.

>at the young Kartog's display.

MIKE:  We're learning a lot more about Kern than we really wanted to know.

>     "Here," Admiral Saavik said, entering the hall.

>     "I am Admiral Saavik Jeric," the Romulan said.  "I come to

MIKE:  A good negotiator always reveals her fallback position in her 
       opening remarks.

>     "And why should we listen to you?" Kern asked.
>     "I am the Romulan representative," Saavik stated.  "I was sent by

CROW:  No, that entitles cows to be herd. It entitles you to be thrown out 
       on your ass.

>     "And what battles have you won," Kern asked.  "What enemies have
>you vanquished?"

TOM:   Well, I finished Spyro the Dragon last week...

CROW:  Notice, in this scene, Marrissa's barefoot and preqnant?

>     Jay smiled in return, and moved to sit on the side of his wife's
>recliner.  "I find it hard to believe that you've done everything just
>so you could marry me."

MIKE:  -Especially- me.

>     "Not all," Marrissa responded.  "Since I was little I wanted to
>grow up to command a starship with a handsome young first officer at
>my side.  We'd have many adventures and a half-dozen children.

CROW:  Half-dozen?
TOM:   Ratliff's channeling the ghost of Heinlein.

>                                                               Though
>if I had known how hard pregnancy was, I would have revised the last."
>     "So I shouldn't expect six screaming children running though our
>quarters any time soon," Jay questioned, his hand on his wife's belly.

MIKE:  Guess it'll be up to little Fetus Amber Flores Picard Jr. to carry 
       on the legacy solo.

>     "Not unless you have them," Marrissa replied, her hand now
>guiding his on her belly.  "Our little Sara's active today."

CROW:  Either they've already named the kid, or, again, we're learning 
       more about Jay than we need to.

>     "She wants out of her swimming pool," Jay joked.

MIKE:  Isn't the third trimester a wee bit early for diving lessons?

>     "Now is not a good time," Marrissa said.  "I can just see it. I'm
>standing before the High Council.  They're just about to announce
>their decision, and my water breaks.

TOM:   More of Jay's fancy swordsmanship, no doubt.

>                                     Sara better stay in there until
>after they decide."

MIKE:  If she knows what's good for her.

>     Saavik paced in her ready room.  Her boots clicking on the green

CROW:  I prefer a Biq Blue Marble floor, myself.

>              She had to send a report back to her older bother and
>didn't know what to say.  

TOM:   Since, other than a few sentences. nothing's actually happened so 
       far.

>                         The door chimed. "Who is it?" she snapped.
>     "Centurion Tillek," a deep baritone responded.

MIKE:  He's the Romulan Bowser.

>     "Enter," she said.  Centurion Tillek had been her personal
>bodyguard since she was ten.  The burley old man had saved her life on
>more than one occasion.

CROW:  Mostly stuff like keeping her from crossing the street, helping her 
       down the stairs... 

>                        He was also her only confidant.  As a member
>of the Praetor's Guard, he was sworn to keep secret anything that his
>changes did.  

TOM:   So, he's either menopausal, constantly revisinq things, or in 
       charge of the Praetorian nursery.

>             In a climate of suspicion like that of the Romulan
>Government, people did not often trust.  Saavik trusted Tillek.  He
>knew a lot about her, and he never told anyone.  

MIKE:  Mainly because his drinking buddies got sick and tired of his 
       stupid Saavik stories.

>                                                He was a dying breed
>on Romulus.
>     "Commander Sanok said you were distrait," Tillek said.

CROW:  He also said you were delicious, delightful, and delovely.

>     "Yes, Uncle Tillek," Saavik replied.  

MIKE:  Looks like the Romulans are adapting Federation nepotism 
       techniques, big-time.

>                                           "I was trying so hard to

TOM:   I never should have brought up my euchre championship.

>                 You're not supposed to make people feel inferior. 
>You have to keep your accomplishments quiet and let others discover
>them."

CROW:  Hey. it worked for Our Humble Author.
TOM:   If Dr. F hadn't discovered Stephen's "accomplishments", we wouldn't 
       be here now.
MIKE:  Race you to the time machine.

>     "Little cat, you've never dealt with Klingons before have you,"
>Tillek remarked.  

CROW:  Little cat?
TOM:   For the remainder of the fanfic, Saavik will be voiced by the late 
       Phil Hartman. 

>                  Saavik shook her head and stopped pacing.  "I
>thought not.  Saavik, with Klingons, the boast is a good way to earn
>their respect.  

MIKE:  Right up there with head butts. drinking contests, and pantsing.

>                Tell me, you were watching Admiral Picard make her
>entrance.  She's dealt with Klingons almost all her life.  How did she
>do it."

CROW:  [Saavik]  So you're saying I should get pregnant?

>     "She drew herself up straight, or as straight as she could in her
>condition," Saavik described.  "She walked, no she strolled into the
>room like she owned it.

MIKE:  Well, this is Marrissa. She probably will own it by the end of the 
       next story.

>                         She bellowed out her titles and
>accomplishments and challenged them to disagree with her.

CROW:  Big deal. That's how she opens every staff meeting.

>                                                          One Council
>member challenged her and her husband, and they embarrassed him by
>making his pants drop."

TOM:   [Tillek] OK, that's not a great idea to emulate, but the rest is 
       good.

>     "That must have been interesting," Tillek smiled.
>     "I barely contained my laughter," Saavik confirmed.

CROW:  I hear they've started calling him "Chancellor Tiny"

>     "And how did you make your entrance," Tillek asked.

MIKE:  Flash pots and a kickin' bass line.

>     "Not good," Saavik said.  "I came in at a dignified pace and said
>my speech in a calm tone.

CROW:  My first sentence took 20 minutes.

>                          I explained our position in a calm manner. 
>It wasn't until the Chancellor asked why he should listen to me that I
>got into what you said the Klingons would respond to."

TOM:   The bribery, the spankings...
CROW:  And after the spankings, the oral...
MIKE:  Lets not go there.
CROW:  What? It's not that dirty.
MIKE:  I mean Holy Grail jokes.

>     "That may still work to your advantage, Saavik.  That you were
>able to stay calm says a lot about you.  I suggest you adopt 'soul of
>ice' as your plan."

TOM:   Be as cold as ice. Be willing to sacrifice your love.

>     "What about playing to the Klingon sensibilities."

CROW:  That's an odd phrase.

>     "Admiral Picard is already doing that.  You can not compete with
>her long experience with Klingons.

CROW:  If you know what I mean.
TOM:   And I think you do.

>                                   Her cousin is even married to the
>Chancellor's nephew.  So try a different tact."

MIKE:  Tact? Klingons need tact like fish need bicycles.
TOM:   Ze homophone iss ze Ratliff's vurst enemy. Zee how hiss 
       spellchecker iss helpless to prevent ze homophone vrom pouncink.

>     "That sounds reasonable," Admiral Saavik mused, taking her seat
>behind the desk for the first time.  "I just hope you're up to a
>little sword fighting.

MIKE:  Because, frankly, all your reasonableness is starting to piss me 
       off.

>                        I'm going to need something to drain of all
>the tensions that are going to occur in the next couple of days."

TOM:   With her uncle? Saavik must be from south of the Romulus-Remus 
       line.

CROW:  And giving Climate Control fits.

TOM:   No trophies, no medals, no Kobayashi Maru collectable card games...

CROW:  Mmmm. ROM Chips.
TOM:   She gets the good stuff, nothing like the generic-brand RAMchips 
       you feed us, Mike.
CROW:  She's my new favorite character.

>                                                               A bowl

MIKE:  Magnificent! The reader feels like they actually -are- a snack on 
       Jackie's desk.

ALL:   TOO LATE!

>               it was a mess.  The young ensign hadn't gotten any

CROW:  And Jackie was pretty tired, too. Wink.

>                           Her eyes had circles around them, 

TOM:   Victim of the old "shoe polish on the tricorder" gag.

>                                                             and she

>Well they aren't getting anymore data from the classifies if I can
>help it." 

MIKE:  Yep. Good luck buying a used dishwasher when Jackie Picard's on the 
       case!

>           Jackie had done everything she could think of to keep the
>hacker from getting any more classified data. 

TOM:   She stored it all on her old Amiga hard drive.

 It now was storied on a
>new server which could only be accessed from three stations on the
>bridge, the ready room, her sister's, Commodore Sulu's and her own
>quarters, plus a VIP quarters located directly below her sister's
>rooms.  

MIKE:  Where any of the ship's guests could read it to help them sleep.

>        Of course that meant that the Hacker would have to find the
>new location first, and the Hacker hadn't seemed to have done that
>yet.

TOM:   Why would the hacker need a new location? The Enterprise's crack 
       security team hasn't found 'em yet.

>     "Commodore Sulu to Ensign Picard," a woman's voice announced over
>Jackie's communicator. 
>     "Jac-, Picard here," Jackie replied, remembering that she was now
>the only Picard on board. 

CROW:  Picard, any card.
TOM:   Is THIS your Picard?

>                           "Sorry, I don't have any more information
>on our hacker, Commodore."

MIKE:  She's been too busy trying to find the enemy's hacker.

>     "That's not what I'm calling about, Ensign," Sulu said.  "I've
>just been informed that your father will be arriving tomorrow
>afternoon.  I thought you might want to know."

TOM:   What a relief. The Picard shortage on the Enterprise was bordering 
       on chronic.

>     "Thank you, Commodore," Jackie said, looking at the mess she'd
>made in the five days since her older sister, Marrissa, and her
>roommate Lynn had left for Kronos. 

CROW:  Wait, I'm confused.
TOM:   It's simple, really. Jacqueline and Jacquelynn are roommates and 
       sisters-in-law. Jacquelynn is Jay's sister, and Jacqueline is 
       Marrissa's sister. Jacqueline misses Jacquelynn, because Jacquelynn 
       is on Kronos with her sister or her sister-in-law, depending on how 
       you parse the pronoun.
CROW:  I feel so much better now.
MIKE:  We now return you to our regularly scheduled Ratliff story.

>                                    "I'll let you know if I find

>     "Very well, Sulu out."

CROW:  SULU!!!! I'M TALKING WITH SULU!!!!

>the mess.

ALL:   [clear throats nervously]

>     Clara Sutter entered. Her eyes had circles under them, telling
>how much her newborn daughter had been keeping her up. 

MIKE:  In the future, everyone will have face-mounted LCD displays.

>                                                       She scanned the

>should be checking on you, Jackie," Clara said.  "This room is a mess,
>although I shouldn't be speaking as my quarters are almost as bad."

CROW:  I want a complete report on the relative messiness of each 
       crewmember's quarters by 0700.

>     "I've been trying to track down that hacker, but I just can't
>seem to find any sign they are still active," Jackie said, placing the
>stale chips and flat grape soda in the replicator for recycling.

TOM:   So, on Star Trek, everyone eats out of the trash bin?

>                                                                 "I
>haven't had time to sleep in two days."

MIKE:  All that hacker inactivity is keeping her up nights.

>     "Jackie, you don't have to short yourself sleep to do a good
>job," Clara said.  "Save that for when you have children. 

TOM:   Only expose the young to your sleep-deprivation psychosis. Your 
       commanding officer deserves better.
MIKE:  Remember, in this universe, odds are those two sets intersect.

>                                                           In fact if
>you don't get some sleep, you are going to be making lots of mistakes. 
>You'll never capture the hacker that way."
>     "I guess," Jackie replied, stacking her ROM chips up neatly.

CROW:  Put 'em in some Tupperware, or they'll go stale.
TOM:   Or just pass 'em down here if you're not hungry anymore.

>                                                                  "I
>just want to do everything well.  I have the family tradition to hold
>up."

MIKE:  And her Picard Family Performance Review is in two weeks!

>     "Jackie, you really want to follow in your sister's footsteps,
>don't you?" Clara guessed, clearing off Jackie's bed.  Jackie nodded. 
>"I wouldn't if I were you.  Marrissa has always been very driven. 

CROW:  If she sees you as a potential rival, she'll use your intestines 
       for a subspace antenna.
TOM:   Calling Marrissa "driven" is like calling Akiva Goldsman 
       "untalented".

>She's pushed herself very hard to get herself where she is now.  She
>hasn't always been happy with her life.  

TOM:   Captain, sensors are detecting a massive auctoral retcon off the

>comfortable with herself until just before she married Jay.

CROW:  And five minutes later, the feeling vanished.

>                                                            Marrissa

MIKE:  I'd avoid kicking soccer balls at her. She hates that.

>                                      I'd try to learn from her
>mistakes."
>     "Marrissa makes mistakes?" Jackie said, somewhat surprised.

CROW:  She makes them on purpose, so as not to make others uncomfortable 
       with her perfection.

>     "Yes, she makes mistakes, just like anyone else," Clara replied. 
>"She pushed herself really hard.  Jay and I were constantly trying to
>get her to relax a little.

MIKE:  But the crowbars just bounced right off of her head.

>                           So, why don't you get some rest?  I'll tell
>Shayna to keep watch on the system, and when you have a good night's
>sleep, I'm sure you'll be able to solve what ever comes your way
>then."

MIKE:  And so, we learn an imnortant lesson.
TOM:   The only thing keeping the entire Picard claa from attaining 
       perfection is an inability to nap.

>Chapter Four

CROW:  This story is moving along rather briskly, considering nothing's 
       actually happened yet.
TOM:   We're lost, but we're making great time!

>
>     Conducting a multi-media presentation was not something that you
>would consider the job of the Commanding Admiral, Star Fleet. 

MIKE:  So we'll forgive Picard for using the Multiple Bars template...
CROW:  And 28-point Arial...
TOM:   And his excessive usage of Screen Beans.
MIKE:  The Office 97 sketch, ladies and gentlemen.

>Marrissa was doing it though.  She had a large screen displaying
>Romulan, Klingon, and Federation space.

TOM:   This is no time to be playing Risk!
CROW:  Betcha Marrissa takes Irkutsk.

       everyone.

CROW:  And we, we intrepid readers, are praying they won't want much.

>     The Romulan representative wasn't attending this session, and
>Marrissa wouldn't be attending the Romulan briefing the later in the

TOM:   But neither of them would be attending the hoedown.
MIKE:  For detailed information on both Marrissa and Saavik's schedules, 
       consult Appendix ZZ.

CROW:  [Marrissa] I'll give you a dollar and be your frfend

ALL:   [boggling, snickering, general incredulousness]
MIKE:  Fighteritus?
TOM:   That's gotta be the one.
CROW:  What "one"?
TOM:   Come on, I'll explain.

[Door Sequence]

MIKE:  Now, what's this about a "one"?
CROW:  You're not going all Cuba Gooding Jr. on us, are you?
TOM;   No. It's like this. Ever since Stephen and Dr. Forrester embarked
       on their unholy alliance lo those many years ago, Stephen's started
       throwing one deliberate thing into each of his stories for us to 
       jump on.
CROW:  Kind of like the Princess and the Pea, only misspelled?
MIKE:  Ah, I get it. And you're saying this "fighteritus" thing is it. 
       Something he put in on purpose for us to make fun of.
TOM:   That's my theory, at least.
CROW:  But wait. We make fun of the whole thing. We have to. It's all bad.
       What difference does one deliberate, leading straight line make in
       a Ratliff story? It's like searching for hay in a haystack!
MIKE:  Maybe it makes him feel better.
TOM:   Maybe he's just a psycho. I don't know. I don't pretend to
       understand 'em, I just ride and rope and brand 'em, and I'm 
       pretty sure "fighteritus" is it.
CROW:  So what do we do with our newfound knowledge? 
TOM:   I don't know.
MIKE:  I say we just go in there, find out what this so-called
       "fighteritus" is all about, and let nature take it's course.
CROW:  Of course you would, Mike. That's the solution involving the least
       effort. But won't there be some consequence to playing right into
       the hands of Stephen's dirty little psych-op?
TOM:   Some consequence worse than actually reading the rest of the story?
CROW:  Good point. And anyway [lights flash] WE'VE GOT MARRISSA SIGN!!!

MIKE:  [Patronizing] OK, Stephen. What's "fighteritus"?

MIKE:  Oh, well that makes... huh?
TOM:   If I'm not scared of the Pope, is that mitreitus?
MIKE:  And by that reasoning, I was way off base in dealing with my 
       sinusitis.
CROW:  So, would the inability to consider the letter "b" a threat be 
       "bitus"?

       -killed- at the Improv last night.

>     "Seriously, is there anything else you'd like to know?" Marrissa
>asked.

MIKE:  Why Timmy threw his clock out the window, perhaps?
TOM:   Or what you think about airplane food?
CROW:  Ooh! Tell us how white people dance!

>     "I do not think so," Kern said.  "You've stated your rather
>strong position, and given us lots of good reasons to support your
>cause."

MIKE:  And that's the bottom line, 'cause Stone Cold Steve Ratliff said 
       so.

>     Kartog interrupted, "I for one, would not mind fighting at the
>side of your Enterprise or any of those Nova Class ships.  They are
>truly, swords of honor."

TOM:   No, truly, they're big honkin' spaceships. 
MIKE:  They're only "swords of honor" in Kartog's twisted little Freudian 
       metaphor world.

>     "I will be sure to pass your compliment on to their designers and
>crews," Marrissa said.  
>     "He-hem. As I was saying, you've said everything we need," Kern
>said.  "I will see you at tonight's banquet."

TOM:   You could say you'll be... the guest of honor. Muahahaha!

>     "Very well," Marrissa said.  She gathered up her stuff and exited
>the room.

CROW:  Gripping "stuff-gathering" action!

>Chapter Five

TOM:   ... is alive!

>     Once again Marrissa and Jay were relaxing in the VIP quarters. 
>"So how do you think you did?" Jay asked.

MIKE:  "I stated my rather strong position, and given them lots of good 
       reasons to support my cause. Weren't you listening?"

>     "I'm worried, Jay," Marrissa replied.  "Kern's dismissal was
>really curt. 

CROW:  Well, to be fair, you just would not shut up.

>             I don't think he wants join the war on our side.  If the
>Council Leader can't support us, then we are a lost cause."

TOM:   Apparently, Kern is suddenly eager to kill his relatives.
MIKE:  Can you really blame him?

>     "He's in a really hard spot," Jay replied.  

MIKE:  "Right between my shoulder blades. Would you get that?"

>                                  "He has relatives in
>Star Fleet, but he has to appear undecided until he has a consensus. 
>You know how hard that can be with Klingons."

CROW:  Appearing undecided? They're handling it pretty well so far.

>     "Well at least Counselor Kartog seemed to be in favor of us,"
>Marrissa said.

TOM:   After Jay's pantsing, why wouldn't he be?

>     "I knew there was a bright spot," Jay said.  "You'll never guess
>who came to relieve the Osaka's Chief Medical officer."

MIKE:  Commander Rolaids?
CROW:  Ten to one it's another cameo.

>     "Who?" Marrissa asked.  "And more importantly why?"
>     "It seems that Doctor Beverly Picard decided that since her
>husband had recovered, it would be advisable to make sure you got the
>best of care when your time came," Jay replied.  

TOM:   [G'Kar] You're time has come and gone! It's our turn now!

>                                                "She gave the CMO a
>runabout ride to Risa and a four week pass."

MIKE:  And put the rest "on account".

>     "I bet Doctor Minizo liked that," Marrissa said.  "Although I'm
>not sure I can stand time under Mom's care."

CROW:  [Beverly] Now bundle up before you go into battle. You'll catch 
       your death! And don't run with that phaser, young lady. You'll 
       vaporise someone's eye.

>     "Is there something wrong with the good Doctor?" Jay asked.
>     "You know my father has said that all Starship Captains should
>take a course on how to escape from Sickbay?"
>     "I have heard."

TOM:   And I have flock. Is this scene over yet?

>     "Well, its necessary because certain CMO's care so much about
>their patients that they are never let out of the Sickbay until every
>molecule is back in the right place," Marrissa said.

MIKE:  Ah, of all the elements of Classic Trek to adopt and keep alive, we 
       chose "captains hate medical care".

>     "And your mother is one of them," Jay concluded.
>     "Yes."

CROW:  This story is closed-captioned for the hyperbole-impaired.

>     Jackie Picard was sleeping peacefully, her body having decided to
>take all the sleep it could while it could.  

ALL:   Aaaah!
MIKE:  I hate it when the subplot sneaks up on us like that.

>                                            A smile graced her face
>and a wisp of her strawberry blond hair had gotten caught in her
>mouth. 

TOM:   Violin music swells, the lens goes all soft-focusy...
MIKE:  And another young character is inadvertently sexualized.

>       Her room was a lot cleaner than it had been in weeks, thanks
>to Clara.  The image was shattered at 0700 hours, when suddenly the
>computer began playing "Stars and Strips Forever."

ALL:   [burst out laughing]
CROW:  Demi Moore IS John Phillips Sousa IN "Stars and Strips Forever".
MIKE:  That does it. I'm swearing off spellcheckers for life.

>     Jackie woke up and jumped out of bed, rubbing her eyes.
>"Computer, turn off alarm," she ordered.  "Give me a summary of any
>computer security notations since 1700 hours yesterday."

TOM:   Well, there was a D# around 2 a.m...

>     "Attempted hack into desert database by Ensign Gomez," the
>computer began.  "Logged off, notation sent to Doctor Johnson."

CROW:  He hacked into the desert on a Trojan horse with no name.

>     "You'd think he'd give up trying to get around his diet by now,"
>Jackie muttered.

MIKE:  Starfleet actually grew out of the Center for Science in the Public 
       Interest.

>     "Attempted access to Flight plan database.  Allowed by Lieutenant
>Sachs. Attempted access of old secured database, trace route failed. 
>Summary of data obtained by trace route saved to secured log.  List of

CROW:  Whatever the hell -that- meant.

>     "Computer, how long until my father arrives?" Jackie asked.

TOM:   "Wait 'Til Your Father Gets Home: The Next Generation."

>     "Fleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard is scheduled to arrive in 2 hours
>35 minutes."
>     "Just enough time to get ready. 

MIKE:  When Picard comes back, everyone put on their bald caps and bury 
       the Statue of Liberty up to her neck.

>                                     Any messages?"
>     "One, from Nicholas Rene Picard, USS Sovereign."
>     "Message summary?"
>     "Dos and Don'ts when Dad arrives."

TOM:   It's the 24th century, and co-workers still haven't stopped 
       forwarding wacky e-mail.

>     "Save message, and remind me of it in an hour."

>     Admiral Saavik was ready for her presentation.  

ALL:   Aaaah!
CROW:  Plot whiplash! Where's my neck brace? I wanna sue.

>                                                     She did not know

>Klingons came on the Romulan side, they would win.  If the Klingons
>joined the Federation side, the life span of the Romulan Star Empire
>had dropped to a few months, if not weeks.

TOM:   I think they're qiving too much credit to a bunch of bumpy-headed 
       worm-eaters, but it is the story's premise, I guess.

>     The set up was the same as it had been for the Federations

>awaiting her words.  Kern spoke up, "Convince us."

MIKE:  And try to keep it under three days.

>     "I'd give you highlight films," Saavik began.  "But, those can be

CROW:  Hint hint, nudge nudge, cough Marrissa's got Photoshop cough.

>         So I'll start with how the Romulan Star Empire planned to
>win, before you announced your intention to join the war. 

MIKE:  These were our stupid plans. They didn't work. Join us!

>                                                          I'm sure my

>been most through in explaining the current situation."

TOM:   That's diplomat speak for "Boy, would that skank EVER shut up?"

>     "You've no doubt heard of what the Federation calls the Battles
>of the Star Fort Line.  It is that set of battles, which the Romulans
>won all but the last two, which gave us the opening we needed."

CROW:  The Star Fort Line. Destined to share a place in history alongside 
       the Maginot Line, the Bottom Line, and the Fishing Line.

>     She pointed to a Star Fort with a Star Fleet Insignia as its
>indicator.  "This is Star Fort Five, recently taken by the Federation. 

MIKE:  Pesky graffiti artists.
CROW:  Be on the lookout for a nerd carrying a can of gold spraypaint.
TOM:   Still, at least it doesn't say "I was captured by a bunch of kids."

>To get to it, the Federation must run a gauntlet of our lines. 

CROW:  Romulan needs food, badly!

>                                                               We

TOM:   I sure hope Marrissa's taking notes.

>                           With that done, three of the Federation's
>Fleets will be cut off from the rest of them.  We will then attack and
>destroy the Federation's forces from that point on their lines up to

CROW:  "Unless, of course, some bizarre, improbable event leads to our 
       entire Empire being subjugated by a pregnant woman. But what are 
       the odds of that?"

>Chapter Six

MIKE:  Because every once in a while, putting up a signpost to your abrupt 
       scene changes is a good thing.

>     "We've got to get that spy," Jackie said, as she looked over the
>list of suspects that Lieutenant Sachs and Commander O'Brien had
>narrowed down while she was sleeping.  

TOM:   Nothing like a nice nap to provide plausible deniability during 
       your pogrom.

>                                       There was just 31 left.  

CROW:  One for each flavor at Baskin-Robbins.

>                                                                When
>she finished skimming it, she looked up and said, "These are all
>certainly capable of hacking into the system.  Ensign Gomez has been
>trying to get around his diet restrictions for weeks."

MIKE:  [singing] All wheat patty on a sesame bun; I love the taste too 
       much, can never stop at one...

>     "Could he be the spy?" O'Brien asked.
>     "I won't rule him out," Sachs said.  "He did have the
>opportunity."

CROW:  Plus, he's a big fatty-fat-fatty, and we hate him.

>     "Gomez just wants a chocolate dipped vanilla ice cream cone,"
>Jackie said.  "It's how I know it's him.  Doctor Johnson has put him
>on a diet and prohibited ice cream. 

MIKE:  400 years in the future, and the big obesity cure is "hands off the 
       Chunky Monkey, Porkins."

>                                    Since the day he got on that
>diet, I've been catching him every night at 1800 hours ordering the
>same forbidden treat.  

TOM:   For God's sakes, already, lay off Gomez!
CROW:  Hasn't the poor guy suffered enough without you stalking him?

>                      I log him off, send him a lecture, and then
>remind myself why I can't have the same treat."

MIKE:  Because you're living in some weird, crypto-fascist anti-dairy 
       pleasure-denying hellhole? Just a guess.

>     "That's right, you're allergic to vanilla," Shayna said.

TOM:   Then this story should turn her into one giant hive.

>     "Yeah, the one thing nobody else is," Jackie stated.  "It's so
>hard to turn down everything with it in.  It just looks so good.  Oh
>well, at least I can have chocolate."

CROW:  Yeah, until Jackson Jefferson Jingleheimer Johnson has another 
       psychotic episode.
TOM:   Then Jackie'll be the one pounding on a console at 1800, sobbing as 
       she reads a stern food lecture from another of the ship's culinary 
       busybodies.

>     "You know, if the spy thought we had gotten the wrong person and
>weren't looking for another, we might be able to catch them," O'Brien
>commented, bringing the conversation back to the task at hand.

MIKE:  Guess its time to have ol' Gomez publicly executed on trumped-up 
       charges. For the good of the Federation and all.

>     "You mean we arrest someone and make it look like we've found
>them," Shayna commented.  "Not a bad idea, any suggestions?"

CROW:  Yeah, one. Stop borrowing plot points from "Matlock".

>     "I have one," Ensign Jackie Picard said.  "At 1800 hours tonight,
>I think Ensign Gomez will be getting an unexpected dessert."

TOM:   Oh, man... poor Gomez.
MIKE:  His only crime was loving too much, in a world he never made.

>     "Sulu to Ensign Picard."
>     "Go ahead."

CROW:  "I heard you were gonna relentlessly torment Fatty Gomez. Can I 
       help?"

>     "The Sovereign has arrived."
>     "Thank you, Captain." Jackie said.  "I'll meet my father in
>transporter room 1.  Picard out.  If you all will excuse me, I've got
>a father to greet."

MIKE:  "And I pray to God I don't smell ice cream on his breath."

>     Marrissa and Jay, along with Jay's sister Lynn returned to their
>quarters after the Klingon banquet.  Jay was somewhat drunk, which was
>to be expected. 
.
MIKE:  I'd be surprised if Jay didn't have a hundred dollar a day coke 
       habit.
TOM:   I would. 
MIKE:  Really?
TOM:   Yeah... no money in Trek, remember?

>                This was a Klingon banquet after all.  Marrissa and
>Lynn had avoided the bloodwine.  Marrissa pleaded Doctor's orders, and
>Lynn was not of age.  

CROW:  That blows, man. I'm old enough to fight, and die, in your little 
       Romulan War, but I'm too young for bloodwine.

>     "Jay, what was that stuff they served us?" Lynn asked, as they
>took seats on the couch.  "It was still moving."

MIKE:  "Moving"? Lynn's got a bigger emotional attachment to food than 
       Gomez.
TOM:   Not you too, Mike.
CROW:  Yeah, lay off Gomez.

>     "Gagh," Marrissa replied, looking up at the ceiling.

CROW:  Murray! The ceiling needs painting!

>                                                          "One of the
>staples of the Klingon diet.  It's suppose to be served while it's

TOM:   If I hadn't nailed that gagh to the plate, it would have muscled up 
       to the edge of the table, and... voom!

>              There is an old Klingon saying, 'there is nothing worse
>than half-dead gagh.'"

MIKE:  Better half-dead than half-Red!

>     "Yes there is," Lynn said.  "Living gagh."

TOM:   George Romero's "Night of the Living Gagh".

>     "You may be right," Marrissa replied.  "I see you enjoyed the
>blood pie though."

CROW:  New Hostess Blood Pies.

>     "It kinda tasted like cherries," Lynn said.  "But I can't see how
>a Klingon restaurant would make money.  It's awful food."

MIKE:  That never stopped TGI Fridays.

>     "Then perhaps you would like to sample the food of Germernus VI,"

TOM:   Their entire cuisine is based around tofu.

>had to eat there, the banquet hall looked like someone had put the
>food on the table and left it to rot for a month."

TOM:   Kind of like Mike's kitchenette.
MIKE:  OK. I'll do the dishes after the experiment.
TOM:   Getting rid of two things that stink in one fell swoop.

>     "Don't remind me," Marrissa said.  "Did you see how the Romulan
>Admiral looked at the food.  She didn't know what to think."

CROW:  Anybody else get the impression that Stephen wrote big chunks of 
       this in class, right before lunch?

>     "Just like the first time anyone tries Klingon," Jay said.  "I
>remember the first time you tried it.  I don't think you ate more than

MIKE:  Except for the strawberry gagh.

TOM:   In which our heroes relate glorious tales of sammiches they have

MIKE:  The evocative Ratliffian scene-setting at work again.

>                  Fleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard and his son Nicholas
>were due to come aboard.  All of them were in Dress uniform.  Behind
>the console was Chief O'Brien, in regular duty uniform.  

CROW:  This Fall, from Playmates.
MIKE:  And the sheer effort of calculating the odds of all these cameos 
       occuring naturally causes the ship's computers to explode. The end.

>     "The Sovereign signals that the Commanding Admiral is ready to
>beam aboard," O'Brien said.
>     "Beam him aboard, Chief," Sulu said.

CROW:  He's getting better. Two shots at a "Beam him a broad" joke blown 
       to hell.

>     Jean-Luc Picard and his son materialized.  The Fleet Admiral wore
>a black and gray formal jump suit, not standard issue.

TOM:   Ah, something from the Space Tommy Hilfiger collection.
 
>                                                       His son wore a

>uniform. 

MIKE:  Fresh off his tour with the Space Village People.

>         Jackie was of the private opinion that it looked nice on
>Nick.

TOM:   Tom was of the public opinion that the word "thought" would have 
       come in pretty damn handy in that sentence.

>     "Welcome aboard, Admiral," Sulu stated.
>     "Thank you, Commodore," Jean-Luc said. 
>     "This is my acting First Officer, Lieutenant Commander Alexander
>Rozhenko," Sulu introduced.
>     "I'm familiar with him, he and my oldest daughter are childhood

MIKE:  [Picard] But let's not have that stand in the way of a brisk round 
       of mutual introductions. Let's all give our ranks again.

>  "How is the new baby, Alex?"

CROW:  Only a Lieutenant, sir. We're very disappointed.

>     "Alexis finally slept though the night last night," Alexander
>said.
>     "Lieutenant Commander Miles O'Brien is our Chief Engineer," Sulu
>said.

TOM:   You may remember him from the years you served together on the 
       Enterprise.

>     "Still running the transporter after all these years, Chief?"
>Jean-Luc said.

CROW:  Everyone else in the Ratliffverse has upward mobility coming out of 
       their pores. What's Miles' problem?

>     "Your daughter drafted me, sir," O'Brien said.
>     "So I heard," Jean-Luc said.

MIKE:  Caught him just short of the Canadian border.

>     "And of course you know my Computer Security Officer," Sulu said.

TOM:   [Picard] Probably, but why don't you introduce us just to be on the 
       safe side.

>     Jean-Luc Picard looked up and down at his daughter.  

CROW:  [wolf whistle]

       exploits...

>                                                    Her strawberry

MIKE:  Amazing what a difference 500 years makes. Wear a Trek uniform to 
       your communion these days and you'll probably get excommunicated.

CROW:  After all, we haven't been introduced yet.

MIKE:  Darling Nicki?

TOM:   Nicki's the Changeling! Get him!

>     "You probably act like it though," Nicholas said.

MIKE:  Fight! Fight!

>     "That will be enough, Nicholas," his father said.  "I assume

TOM:   If that's not a startlingly Orwellian turn of phrase, I don't know 
       what is.

>     "Fine, father," Jackie said.  "I assume Nicki has been keeping

MIKE:  I've heard kids'll do that to a marraige.

       best "Kobayashi Maru time".

CROW:  Or are you just a pretentious, pan-galactic Merlin Olsen?

CROW:  So... Jackie's messy?
TOM:   I think that's the trope he's trying to pound through our skulls, 
       yes.

CROW:  Jackie Lemmon and Nicholas Matthau in "Grumpy Old Cadets".

MIKE:  Oh, the usual things all officers go through... like puberty.

>     "Orange Strawberry Bannana juice, one ice cube; grape soda, third
>crushed ice," Jackie ordered.  

TOM:   I bet after a couple of years of incredibly picky ordering habits, 
       Starfleet replicators just snap and start spitting out high-grade 
       heroin.

>and his sister sat down on her couch. 

TOM:   Nick goes right for the conversational jugular!

>     "Not quite," Jackie said.  "I'm just learning that it's a lot of
>hard work too. How is your dream coming?"

MIKE:  [Nick] Well, Troi's just taken off her bra...

TOM:   Wanna know the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the 4,097th bunch of 
       Reislings?

  "I've tended the vines.  We've help repair the bottler, you

TOM:   That oughta take him about a year and a half.

>     "Well, you do have better taste," Jackie said.
>     "I don't know, I think his are better looking," Nicholas said

MIKE:  Oh, Jean-Luc? Joan Crawford on line two. Something about you 
       getting some family counseling, pronto.

>pillow.

TOM:   And setting it to "Vaporize".

>     "Why Jack? Can't stand the fact that a horse looks better than

>stand so the room's round table was between him and her.

CROW:  Knocking over Lancelot's glass of mead and spilling it in 
       Guenivere's lap.

>impacted Nicholas on the face. It slid down into his arms.  

TOM:   It gasped softly as his hands caressed its contours.

MIKE:  Consider yourself on report, Ensign DeeDee. And get out of my 
       laboratory.

>     "I'm your older sister, I can hit you with a pillow any time I
>want to," Jackie said, picking up the other pillow from the couch, and
>moving to throw it.

CROW:  I think this pillow fight's gotten more setup than the entire 
       Romulan War.

>     Just as she released it, her own face was hit with Nicholas's

TOM:   If they both announce they're not left-handed, I'm outta here.

MIKE:  They were busy carving "I WAS BEATEN BY MY SIBLING" in each others' 
       flesh with rusty razors.

CROW:  Gee, you think?
TOM:   Be gentle. It's a consequence in a Ratliff story. It's probably 
       frightened and lonely.
CROW:  Which reminds me... there's something I want to show you guys.

[Door Sequence]

SOL Bridge. There's a large flipchart easel type thing with a diagram on 
it, screen left. Crow stands in front of it with a pointer.]

MIKE:  What's up, Crow?
CROW:  I'm noticing a trend in recent Ratliff works. A terrifying and 
       disturbing trend with implications that stretch far beyond our 
       little satellite. I call that trend "characterization retcon".
TOM:   Sounds serious, buddy. What is it?
CROW:  Let me give you a hypothetical example. Let's say, hypothetically,
       there's a person named Mellie. Now, Mellie is a babe.
MIKE:  Crow, this doesn't make any sense.
CROW:  It doesn't have to, Mike. This is a hypothetical example. Now,
       Mellie is a babe. And this "Mellie", let's say she meets up with
       some other being, say, an "Odie". Odie is also a babe.
TOM:   You mean the dog from Garfield? That doesn't make any sense either.
CROW:  Not the dog from Garfield, and again, it doesn't have to make any
       sense. It's a -hypothetical example-. Now let's say that when these
       two babes meet, chaos spreads throughout the known universe.
MIKE:  Crow, that makes even LESS sense than it did before.
CROW:  IT'S A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE! HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE! What part of the
       phrase "HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE" don't you understand, meat puppet?
MIKE:  OK, OK, Crow, calm down. Fine. Mellie is a babe, Odie is a babe,
       they meet, chaos erupts, none of it makes any sense, hypothetical
       example, stop caring. Is that pretty much the gist of it?
CROW:  Right. Now, flash forward a couple of weeks. Tom has a realization.
TOM:   Is this my cue?
CROW:  Duh.
TOM:   Right. Hey, Crow, that doesn't make any sense!
MIKE:  Tom... hypotheti...
CROW:  [Interrupting] Let the bot speak, Mike.
TOM:   As I was saying... [glares at Mike] That doesn't make any sense.
       Two babes meeting isn't nearly enough to cause chaos to erupt on
       a universal level.
CROW:  Hey, Tom, you're right! Now, Mike. At this point, you agree, don't
       you, that I'm pretty much screwed? Here I am going on about babes
       and chaos, and it's pretty much unworkable. It doesn't make any
       sense. What should I do?
MIKE:  Admit it's a hypothetical example and move on?
CROW:  WRONG! I use the power of "characterization retcon" that I learned
       from Ratliff, and now explain that the chaos was in fact actually
       caused by the meeting of THREE babes, Mellie, Odie, and Jen, and
       it was actually always like that all along forever and ever even
       though I never mentioned it before and anyway maybe I'll go back
       and rewrite my hypothetical example so that Jen was there all along
       and I'll erase the older version so it never happened. [deep
       breath] There. See?
TOM:   Wait, Crow, are you implying what I think you're implying? That
       Ratliff...
MIKE:  No, it can't be. It's too horrible to even consider that Ratliff...
CROW:  I'm afraid so, guys. Stephen Ratliff has a promising career ahead
       of him. As a DC Comics editor.
MIKE:  Nooooooo!

[Lights flash]

CROW:  Even worse: We've got fanfic siiiiign!
TOM:   The horror... the horror.

[Door Sequence]

>                                But Jackie was only twelve, and
>Nicholas ten.  A little bit of play was expected of them.  Of course,
>running around Jackie's quarters throwing pillows was not really
>acceptable behavior, but he would let them get away with it just a
>little longer.

MIKE:  Before forcing them to engage in play-type behaviors duly approved 
       by God, The Queen, and Marrissa.

>     Jackie's next throw missed her little brother and hit her father
>instead.  She didn't notice, since she was dodging Nicholas's throw. 

CROW:  Yet another incident of "friendly fire" in Marrissa's happy 
       Starfleet.

>"Jacqueline Marie Picard, what did I tell you about throwing things
>inside of your quarters," Jean-Luc Picard said with mock seriousness. 
>Both siblings turned toward their father.  Their expressions were of
>false innocence, seemly pasted on their faces.

MIKE:  Real emotions are for the enlisted men!

>     "Don't do it," Jackie replied, hiding the other pillow behind her
>back.  "But, I'm not under your roof any more."
>     "Think again Jackie," Jean-Luc said. "As Commanding Admiral, all
>starships are under my roof."

CROW:  And therefore my surveillance of female officers' sonic showers is 
       completely justified.

>     "But father, you are currently relieved of duty for medical
>reasons, and our older sister holds that position until you return,"
>Nicholas contributed.

TOM:   [Jean-Luc] Goddamned barracks lawyer! I should have you shot!

>     "You do have a point," Jean-Luc said, as Jackie scored a direct
>hit in the face with her pillow.  Jean-Luc Picard responded quickly,
>capturing his daughter and picking up the girl in his arms.  "And you,
>young lady should have known better.  Now what should I do with you?"

MIKE:  Put her down, end this scene, and get on with the plot?

>     "Dad, you're not suppose to lift heavy objects," Nicholas said.
>     "Did you just call your sister heavy, Nicholas?" Jean-Luc said. 
>Nicholas nodded.  "You're not suppose to comment of a woman's weight,
>young man.  Even if she is a little heavy."

CROW:  She's a much better hacker than Ensign Gomez.
MIKE:  Who?
TOM:   Ensign Gomez. He's from the "Non-Jackie's Quarters" part of the 
       story. You remember. "Fatty".

>     "Daddy, I'm not a little girl that you can carry to the swimming
>hole and toss in when her temper gets out of control," Jackie said.

>     The Klingon High Counsel returned to the main chamber after an
>extensive debate in an executive session.  

CROW:  Hi. I'm the plot. Remember me? Hope you enjoyed our little pillow 
       fight interlude. Now, more Klingons talking.

>                                             Admiral Saavik, Admiral
>Marrissa Picard, and Captain Jay Gordon stood waiting.  Emperor
>Kahless headed the procession, taking his place in the ceremonial
>throne. 

MIKE:  He'd had a big ceremonial burrito for lunch, you see.

>        By recent tradition, he would not speak on policy maters. 
>That was for Chancellor Kern to handle.  The Counsel filed in behind
>the Chancellor who took up station to the right of the Emperor on a
>slightly lower dais. 

CROW:  The Chancellor was exactly 1.28 meters to the right of Emperor 
       Kahless, who was positioned exactly 1.28 meters to the left of the 
       Chancellor, only .32 meters higher up, making the Chancellor nearly 
       one third of a meter lower than Kahless.

>     Kern waited until all the council was in place before announcing,
>"It is the uncontested decision of the Klingon Empire that we join the
>war, effective immediately.  

MIKE:  Wait a second... this is it, guys!
CROW:  What do you mean, "it"?
MIKE:  The Klingon decision. The whole point of the story. The fate of the 
       galaxy rests on the very next sentence Ratliff writes!
TOM:   That's it? Here? Now? This is all there is? One more sentence, and 
       then it's all denouement?
MIKE:  Yep. Brace yourselves, guys. The story's dramatic peak is coming 
       up... right... NOW!

>                            We have chosen to enter the war on the
>side of the United Federation of Planets.  

MIKE:  There. Marrissa won.

>                                          The Romulan representative
>will be given 24 hours to leave the Empire.  If at that time they have
>not left the bounds of the Empire, they will be considered a hostile
>vessel of war."

TOM:   If, however, they do make it out of the Empire in time, they will 
       still be considered a bunch of pointy-eared doodyheads.

>     "Understood, honorable council leader," Admiral Saavik said. 

CROW:  [Saavik] (cough) (cough) Dumbass! (cough)

>"But know this, you decision will be the undoing of the Klingon
>Empire."  Saavik turned and left the chamber."

MIKE:  Taking her extraneous quotation mark with her in a show of disgust.

>     "Admiral Picard, let us plan our strategy so our entry may be one
>of great impact," Kern said.

CROW:  That's the single most pompous come-on line in the history of the 
       universe.

>     It wasn't more than five minutes later, that the Osaka
>interrupted the meeting with a frantic call.  

TOM:   MAYDAY! MAYDAY! WE HAVE A WARP CORE BREACH! DO YOU HAVE ANY GREY
       POUPON!

>                                             "Osaka to Admiral Picard
>and Captain Gordon.  We've got a fleet of at least forty Romulan
>warbirds lead entering the system."

MIKE:  Lead? They must be Starfleet Battles miniatures! Sound the alarm!

>     "I have to return to my ship," Marrissa excused herself.  "I
>suggest you call for all the ships you've got.  If this is anything
>like what they did with us, we've got a problem.  Picard to Osaka, two
>to beam directly to the bridge."

CROW:  It would be undignified to have Marrissa waddling slowly to her 
       command chair, I suppose.

>     The two Star Fleet Officers dematerialized.  The council quickly
>moved to get to their own commands.

MIKE:  Except for Kahless, who, well, wasn't quite done on the Ceremonial 
       Throne.

>
>     On the bridge of the Osaka, Marrissa moved take a seat in the
>command chair.  A twinge of pain crossed her face.  "Ops, send the
>following message, channel two, 'It's Friday,'" she ordered.

TOM:   Hooray! An ultracompetent, oversexed, adult Heinlein female is here 
       to save the day!
MIKE:  Don't get your hopes up. It's probably just a dumb code phrase 
       loosely inspired by Kirk's "By The Book" thing in Wrath of Khan.

>     "But sir, it's Tuesday," Ops said.

CROW:  [Ops] Which means you owe me for that hamburger, Marrissa. Pay up.

>     "I know," Marrissa said.  "Jay, I need a tactical overview of the
>system."  Jay handed her a PADD.  "Thanks.  Put the Romulans on
>screen."

CROW:  Any tactical overview is dramatically improved by actually 
       including your enemies.

>     A fleet of over seventy Warbirds appeared.  "How did all those
>ships get this far into the Klingon Empire?"  Jay wondered.

TOM:   And how did they cram all of that graham?

>     "Chancellor Kern is hailing the Romulans," Ops announced.  "He's
>asking them why.  No reply from the Romulans.  He's ordered the
>Klingon third fleet to attack."

MIKE:  Yeah. I bet the first and second fleets are back at homeworld, 
       making sure Kern has his scaly, ridged, bureaucratic hinder 
       covered.

>     "Take us in, CONN," Marrissa ordered.  "Ops, same channel, 'no
>unlucky number.'"

CROW:  Lovely. Marrissa spends two days in "intense" negotiations on the 
       Klingon homeworld, and the only intrigue in the entire story comes 
       from Marrissa's goofy coded message to set up her prearranged, 
       preordained victory.

>
>     As the Romulans began engaging the Klingon Fleet, to the Romulan
>rear, another fleet appeared.  It was not a Romulan one.  

MIKE:  It was not a Klingon one.
TOM:   It was not a Gorn one.
CROW:  It was not crewed by buxom, naked women.
MIKE:  It was not made entirely of creme brulee.

>                                                         These ships
>all bore Star Fleet Insignia.  It consisted of an even hundred Defiant

TOM:   AKA The Defiant One...Hundred.
CROW:  AKA Defiant Ex Machina.

>              As the Defiant Class vessels opened fire, an
>announcement came over channel two.  "This is Vice Admiral Benjamin
>Sisko on the USS Defiant commanding the Thirteenth Fleet, reporting as
>ordered, sir."

MIKE:  Hey, Sisko! It really -is- Deus Ex Machina.
CROW:  Guess Stephen won't be able to sell -this- story to Pocket Books 
       for a tidy Prophet.

>     Seventy Romulan Warbirds, one Warhawk Cruiser verse the eighty-
>one ships of various classes of the Klingon Third fleet, the hundred
>ships of Star Fleet's Thirteenth Fleet, and the USS Osaka.  It wasn't
>exactly a fair fight.  

TOM:   Just the way Our Heroine likes it. Overwhelming odds, easy 
       massacre.

>                      Now if Star Fleet had only had the Osaka, then
>the Romulans would have had a chance.  In fact, they probably would
>have won.  However, they were sandwiched between the Klingons and Star
>Fleet.  It was not a pretty sight.  

MIKE:  Geez, Steve. No need to rub it in. The Romulans are screwed. We get 
       it. Move on to the rampant bloodletting so we can find out what 
       happened to poor Ensign Gomez.

>
>     While the Osaka wove in and out of the edge of the battle,
>Marrissa grimaced in pain.  "Jay, I think I better head to Sickbay,"
>she stated. 
>     "Why?" Jay said, his attention on the viewscreen as the Osaka
>dove toward another warbird.

CROW:  Jay was confused. His wife usually reveled in the spray of green 
       blood, rapidly crystallized by the cold vacuum of space, that 
       accompanied each of her horribly lopsided victories.

>     "I think I'm going into labor," Marrissa said as a contraction
>over took her.

MIKE:  The USS Contraction was one of the new, faster Uterus class 
       starships, and easily outpaced the Osaka.

>     "What!" Jay said. "You aren't due for another week."
>     "I know," Marrissa said.  "I better get down there."
>     Jay helped his wife up and toward the turbolift.  "Commander
>Masato, you have the bridge." he ordered before the turbolift door
>closed.

CROW:  And so, the circle is complete.
TOM:   Out of death, comes new life.
MIKE:  Out of implausible coincidence, another Marrissa Story draws to a 
       close.

>Chapter Eight

MIKE:  Home stretch, guys.
TOM:   Great! I can't wait to find out what happens with the battle, and 
       with Marrissa's pregnancy, and the Klingons...

>Engineering from his office.  

TOM:   ...ah, crap. We've switched subplots again.

MIKE:  WHO IS ENSIGN SOZE?!?!?!

>          Usually one heard about the officer's children, or where

CROW:  In other words, alternatingly boring as hell or incredibly 
       revolting.

>     "Did you hear about Ensign Gomez?"

TOM:   I heard he's fat.

>     "I heard he got caught hacking."

CROW:  I heard he's a big fat hacker.

>     "Probably was trying to that ice cream cone that Doc Johnson
>prohibited."

MIKE:  'Cause he's fat. Gomez can't stop eating ice cream. He's like a big 
       fat ice cream eating machine.

>     "I don't know, Security has been looking for someone rather hard
>lately."

CROW:  And Gomez isn't hard, he's soft. Because he's fat. And he can't 
       stop eating ice cream.

>     "Nah, Gomez doesn't have the personality of a spy."

TOM:   His personality's more of the big fat ice cream eating type. And 
       he's a fatty boombalatty.

>     "And like you're such a good judge of character."

MIKE:  Yeah, I remember when you said Gomez wasn't fat. How wrong you 
       were.

>     "What's that suppose to mean?"

CROW:  Are you saying I'm fat, like Gomez? Take it back!

>     With that, Miles O'Brien entered Main Engineering.  "That's

       we forget that.

>So the injury was not a totally unwelcome event.  He did hate to spend
>so much time recovering, but it had given him time to get to know his

TOM:   Of course, Nicholas could never mean as much to Jean-Luc as his 1/8 
       size clone of himself... Mini-Pi.

>                     Nicholas had always been good at getting him to

MIKE:  That's when Nick would break Picard off a piece of that Kit-Kat 
       bar.

TOM;   Those wacky Picards. Even when the troublemakers cut classes, it's 
       to attend more difficult classes.

TOM:   Baldy's really kind of thick, isn't he. It takes him a whole two 
       hours to figure out Q's little time travel conundrum, and that's 
       WITH lots of hints, and now, he's still caught off guard by the 
       incredible probability nexus that surrounds his female offspring.

TOM:   He could hear the whirring of the opener as it went to work on the 
       cans of beans. "Damn Jeffries' Hoboes," Picard thought as he sipped 
       his tea.

>                                        He had been briefed about the
>spy on the Enterprise, and knew of his daughter's plans.  Jean-Luc
>Picard had been a Starship Captain for more than four decades.  Such
>people are very rarely caught totally unprepared. 

MIKE:  This, however, was one of those times. Ergo, Picard wet 'em.

>                                                  So when the computer
>panel began displaying classified data, he was ready.  Having a
>daughter who spent her early years taking everything apart had it's
>uses.  Two presses upward, and the cover was off.  

CROW:  Steve's really got some serious "allocation of positional 
       information" issues, doesn't he.

>                                                  His rank bar was
>placed precisely across a small section of contacts.  A shower of
>sparks went off.  The panel wouldn't be used for quite sometime.  Some
>movement was heard in the jefferies tube behind the wall.

TOM:   It sounded like the Hokey Pokey, done in full Klingon armor.

>                                                          Then out in
>the corridor, a yelp.  A familiar yelp. It was Nicholas.  
>     Out into the corridor, Jean-Luc ran, heedless of the fact that he
>had no weapon.  Nicholas was being held by a male vulcanoid in
>Engineering yellow.  A phaser was pressed to his head.  "Stay right
>there Admiral, unless you want this boy hurt."

MIKE:  Well, he's not Marrissa, so, you know, fire away.

>     "What do you want?" Jean-Luc asked.  "It's not like you can get
>off this ship."
>     "That's exactly what I intend to do," the spy said.

TOM:   [Picard] "Oh... well, never mind then."

>     At that Jackie came around the bend, her phaser drawn.  "And how
>are you going to do that?" she said.   "I've notified Security. 
>Lieutenant Sachs won't let you go anywhere.  And if you just happen to
>steal a ship, Commodore Sulu won't let you go much further, Ensign
>Silvok, if that is you real name."

CROW:  "Silvok"? Of course that's not his real name. What kind of 
       pseudonym does it take to make Security suspicious, anyway? 
       "Catchme Imaspy"?

>     "I don't think they'll want me to harm the Admiral's son," Silvok
>said.  "And it is my real name."

CROW:  Liar.

>     "It's a shame then," Jackie said.  "Too bad you don't have a
>creditable threat."
>     "What do you mean, I've got a phaser to your brother's head!"
>Silvok said.

MIKE:  "Yeah, but I don't -like- him."

>     "He does have a point," Jean-Luc said.

TOM:    "Dad, you're NOT helping here." 

>     "Well, that's a phaser stolen from armory panel number fifty
>five," Jackie said.  "All phasers shipboard have an automatic disable
>circuit.  The ship is currently programmed to disable phasers not held
>by authorized personnel.  Currently, that's only security personnel
>like myself."

MIKE:  Would you like me to explain any more of our secret security 
       procedures to you, Mr. Spy, or do you want to surrender?

>     Silvok moved to take Nicholas into more physically threatening
>position, but that was the opening Jackie needed.  She fired.  It
>caught the spy in his left shoulder.  He slump, then fell to the
>floor, unconscience. 

CROW:  Well, duh, he's a Romulan spy. Of course he wouldn't have a 
       conscience.

>     "Thanks Jack," Nicholas said, rubbing where the phaser had been
>pressing into his head.
>     "You're welcome, Nicki," Jackie said.  "Jackie Picard to
>Security, I've captured our spy.  Please send some officers to take
>Ensign Silvok to the brig."

MIKE:  Think we should let Fatty Gomez off the hook?
TOM:   Nah. Let him stew. It'll be good for his giant waistline.

>     "Jackie, is there really such a control in phasers," Jean-Luc
>said.  "I don't remember one."

CROW:  "Of course, most days I can't remember my own name... didn't I have 
       some tea?"

>     "There is a power level restricter, but nothing that specific,"
>Jackie replied.  "But Ensign Silvok was an Warp Engineer, so I didn't
>think he'd know much about hand phaser design."

TOM:   Of course, he was also a ROMULAN SPY, so maybe that little pillow 
       fight with Nicholas bugged you more than you realize.

>     "You mean you risked my life on a bluff," Nicholas said.
>     "You can't argue with success," Jackie said, as four security
>officers arrived to take Ensign Silvok to the brig.

CROW:  Well, you can argue with -stupid- success...

>     "Oh really?" 
>     "Nicholas, don't hit your sister."

ALL:   Waaaa waaaa waaaa waaaaaaaaaaa....

>     In the Osaka's Sickbay, Doctor Beverly Picard was preparing to
>deliver her second grandchild.  Marrissa had been an almost model
>patient.  

MIKE:  However, any minor imperfections would be ignored and glossed over 
       for the safety of all present.

>        She did plainly want it to be over with, but she hadn't made
>any threats on her husband's anatomy, and in Doctor Picard's
>experience that was a good sign. 

CROW:  Mr. Ratliff? I've got Bill Cosby's lawyers on Line 2.

>     "Jay," Marrissa said between contractions.
>     "Yes Marrissa," Jay replied.

TOM:   Also between contractions, which was odd.
MIKE:  Maybe he had some of Kahless' burrito.

>     "We're never doing this AGAIN," she said as a contraction took
>her.

TOM:   "Screw the author's hangups. I'm going on the pill!"

>     "One more push hard, Marrissa," the Doctor said.  Moments later
>after two hours of pushing and grunting, little Sarah Alara Picard was
>born.  She cried loudly as the doctor took her to clean her up.

CROW:  Now, now, have a little patience, Sarah. We can't have you getting 
       the Kobayashi Maru test seat all messy.

>
>     Soon Marrissa was laying in recovery, her daughter in her arms,
>and Jay holding her in a protective embrace.  "She's beautiful,"
>Marrissa said, staring at the little baby girl sucking at her breast.  

BOTS:  AAAAAAAAH!
MIKE:  Now, now, it's perfectly natural part of... DEAR GOD! MAKE IT STOP! 
       MAKE IT STOP!

>     "Just like her mother," Jay said.
>     "Jay."
>     "Yes Mara."
>     "About what I said earlier, forget it," Marrissa said.

TOM:   Contraception is for the proles. Let's breed like rabbits!

>     "What did you say earlier?" Jay said, kissing his wife.
>     "Oh, and Jay, next time I have to leave the bridge, stay and
>finish the battle."

CROW:  Yeah, it's not like you had any real part in this beyond the 
       donation of your seed.

>
>Orders of the Day, Star Fleet Command.
>Fleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard resuming command.

MIKE:  But... for how long? For.... how long?

>Commodore Demora Sulu promoted to Rear Admiral and reassigned to take
>command of the newest Nova Class starship, the Lexington and the
>Twenty-First Fleet.

CROW:  Interesting literary device, using the promotion of Sulu's daughter 
       to bookend your story.

>
>The Excelsior, the Lake Superior, and the George C. Scott reassigned
>from the First Fleet to the Twenty-First.  Captain Hikaru Sulu to
>serve as Executive Officer of the said fleet.

TOM:   The old man under the young woman. It's just like Hollywood.

>
>The Georgia, the Damocles, and the Scott Jamison to join First Fleet. 
>Commander Masoto assigned as Captain of the Osaka.

MIKE:  So, as epilogue, Stephen moves the pushpins around on his homemade, 
       wall-size "Map Of The Future Federation", and tells us about it.

>
>Captain Jay Gordon promoted to Commodore and assigned Command of the
>First Fleet, per recommendations.  Admiral Marrissa Picard placed on
>maternity leave, one month.

CROW:  By which point her daughter will be totally self-sufficient and 
       ready to take command of the Fifteenth Fleet.

>Commendations issued, Battle of Kronos: Admiral Marrissa Picard; Vice
>Admiral Benjamin Sisko, commanding Thirteenth Fleet; Captains Leedson,
>Harrison, and Duncan of the Monitor, Merrmac, and Dreadnought
>respectively; Commander Shinji Masoto, First Officer, USS Osaka.

MIKE:  It's like the SAT's. Medals:Starfleet Officers::Fish:Shamu

>Commendations issued, Battle of Star Fort 16: Captains Savek and
>Tassadar of the George C. Scott and the Swiftsure.  

CROW:  Was that even in this story?
TOM:   I don't think so, but this stuff's gotta get taken care of 
       somewhere, right?
MIKE:  Yep. Can't let your fictional characters go without their fictional 
       medals.

>General Watches: Warhawk Bloodfire, escaped from Battle of Kronos. 
>Expected to be damaged.  Capture if possible.  Be on the look out for
>any new Warhawk class vessels.  A mine field has been discovered near
>Star Fort 12.  Indications of other mining activities have been
>spotted.  Please report any signs to Admiral Epperly, acting head of
>Star Fleet Operations.

CROW:  Oh, I get it! Stephen's trying to show us that despite the vast, 
       cosmic events going on around us, there's still a lot of mind-
       numbing, tedious detail to be remembered.

>
>End General Orders from Commanding Admiral Star Fleet, aboard USS
>Enterprise.

MIKE:  And now, the specific orders.

>Epilogue

TOM:   You mean, "Even More Epilogue".

>     Admiral Marrissa Picard spent the next month getting to know her
>new daughter.  

TOM:   Assessing her. Testing her. Ensuring she was worthy to carry the 
       name.

>              Her husband took over command of the Enterprise and the
>First Fleet.  Fleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard spent the time on the
>Enterprise, with his children, commanding the fleet.

CROW:  Sending out general orders by the metric buttload!

>     The addition of the Klingon Empire sped the end of the Romulan
>Star Empire.  The attack on Kronos insured that only it's complete
>surrender and end would end the war.  

TOM:   I think at this point, Ratliff's just taunting us by using the word 
       "end" over and over and over again without actually ending the 
       story.

>                                     The Klingons would except no
>less.  In that month that she was off, the noose tightened on the
>Romulans.  

MIKE:  Slaughtering Romulans... while Marrissa stays at home? Heads will 
       roll.

>     When Marrissa returned to duty, the Federation and the Klingons
>were ready for the final blow, the capture of Romulas and Remus.  It
>was hers to lead, in our finial volume of the last Romulan War, After
>the Storm we'll tell that story.

CROW;  Tune in next week for another exciting installment of "True Stories 
       of the Starfleet Patrol"!

>Professor John P Hereomise III

TOM:   Here, omise! Here, omise omise omise!

>History Department Chair
>Professor of late 24th Century History
>University of Essex.

MIKE:  He's a real specialist. He covers July, 2399 to December, 2399.

>Appendix

>Cast in order of appearance: (positions in order of obtaining them)

TOM:   Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 54th annual Stephen Ratliff 
       Memorial Name and Rank Parade!

>Name                Rank Position
>Marrissa Picard     ADM  Commanding USS Enterprise NCC-1701-F
>                         Commanding First Fleet
>                         Commanding Admiral, Star Fleet

CROW:   It's really a beautiful day for a parade here in sunny Virginia, 
        Tom. And here's our first float, heading up the parade, as she 
        does every year, it's Marrissa!

>Kern son of Mog          Gen. Chancellor of the Klingon High Council
>Jay Gordon          CPT  Executive Officer, First Fleet
>                         Adjutant to the Commanding Admiral
>                         Commanding Officer, USS Osaka
>                         First Officer, USS Enterprise NCC-1701-F

MIKE:   The Kern float's a little small this year, but budget cuts in the 
        Klingon Empire limited them to just the one rank. Luckily, the 
        lavish Jay Gordon float follows closely behind!
CROW:   Impressive. Where DID they find that many bland, pastel flowers?

>Jacqueline Picard   Ens. Computer Security Officer, USS Enterprise
>Saavik Jeric        Adm. Commander of the Warhawk Bloodhawk
>Sanok               Cdr. First Officer of the Warhawk Bloodhawk
>Shayna Sachs        Lt.  Chief of Security USS Enterprise
>                         Second Officer

TOM:    It's always nice to see these young, wholesome ladies waving to 
        throngs of cheering passersby.

>Miles O'Brien       LCD  Chief Engineer, USS Enterprise
>Demora Sulu         Com  Commanding USS Osaka
>                         Commanding USS Enterprise
>                         Commanding First Fleet

CROW:   And making their triumphant return to the Name and Rank Parade 
        this year, it's the Trek Cameo Marching Band!

>Tillek              Cent Admiral Saavik's personal bodyguard and
>                         old friend
>Kartog              Cons Member of the Klingon High Council

MIKE:   And as he's done so many years before, Kartog delights us all by 
        dropping his pants and mooning the crowd. Way to go, Kartog!

>Jacquelynn Gordon   Ens. Officer USS Osaka, sister of Jay
>Beverly Picard      Adm. Chief of Star Fleet Medical
>                         Chief Medical Officer, USS Osaka
>Jean-Luc Picard     FAD  Commanding Admiral Star Fleet (on medical
>                         leave)
>Nicholas Picard          son of Jean-Luc and Beverly Picard (age 10)

TOM:   And last, but certainly not least, it's the acrobatic magic of The 
       Flying Picards!
MIKE:  Well, it's been another great year for the 54th annual Stephen 
       Ratliff Memorial Name and Rank Parade. On behalf of my fellow 
       commentators Thomas Servo and Kathie Lee Crow, I'd like to wish you 
       and yours a very happy Marrissa Story. Good night, and Ratliff 
       bless.

CROW:  Pull that .sig over, son. You're seven lines over the legal limit.

[Door Sequence]

SOL Bridge. Crow has a fake womb strapped to his abdomen. Servo has a pair
of Spock ears stuck to his head, and is wearing a green smock type thing.
Gypsy stands behind Crow, a plastic sword in her mouth.

MIKE:  What's all this about now, guys.
TOM:   The First Robot War, remember? We're still at a stage of even
       advantages, and the fate of the satellite hinges on who you side
       with!
MIKE:  Oh, alright. State your cases.
CROW:  I am Crow T. Robot, gold-netted vixen, captain of the load pan
       bay, maintainer of the bottle cap collection, and heir to that 
       leftover pastrami in the fridge. And I say that any Mike who
       doesn't side with me is a big doodyhead! 
MIKE:  Hey, watch it...
GYPSY: Stand back, buster, or I'll pants you!
MIKE:  OK, OK...
TOM:   I am Tom Servo. I am the son of a preacher man and my brother ain't
       heavy, he's the Praetor. I destroyed 4,000 Yllabian Space Guppies
       just the other day playing Defender II on that cool compilation 
       pack. You know, the one with Joust 2 on it?
MIKE:  So you are a warrior, not some mindless bureaucrat. I like you.
TOM:   Side with us, or we'll throw our fleets against your phasers until
       we're all dead!
CROW:  I like to lose on purpose!
MIKE:  Enough! You are both pathetic excuses for warriors. I declare that
       the First Robot Wars have been won by Gypsy!
GYPSY: Hooray!
TOM:   What a ripoff. You'll pay for this, Nelson. Know this. Your
       decision will be the undoing of this satellite.
GYPSY: Oh, bite me, Tom.
MIKE:  What she said. Anyway, the Adults Crew are calling.

In the background, Observer and Bobo are both bent over large trash bins.
The sound of vomiting can be heard throughout the entire scene.

PEARL: Wow, he really did write one. "A Different Path". Marrissa...

PEARL: Make room, guys, I'll be over there in a second. [shudders] As
