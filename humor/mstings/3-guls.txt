<The Satellite of Love>

[One of the floor panels is popped out. Mike is in the innards
of the Satellite, invisible to Cambot. Tom is standing by the 
edge of the hole. He's got a lamp on his head, and is shining 
the light down so Mike can see.
On the floor by the hole is a tray filled with various tools.]

Tom: So what's the deal, Mike? What sordid secrets do the uncharted 
	inner bowels of the Satellite of Love hold?
Mike: Oh, not much. Mostly dust bunnies, a few candy wrappers, a bunch
	of Crow's screenplays. Why?
Tom: Oh, I think it's just fearfully exciting is all. You know, the -
Mike: Hey, Tom, could you shine that light over a bit?
Tom: Oh, oh yeah. [bends forward a little more] How's this?
Mike: That's it, thanks. What were you saying?
Tom: The little bits that accumulate over time, the mystery, 
	the nostalgia...
Mike: Hey, there's something down here called "A Patrick Swayze 
	Christmas." What's that?
Tom: Oh, uh, nothing worth remembering.
Mike: Hm. Hey, could you pass me the hydrospanners?
Tom: Yeah, sure. [He slides the metal tray containing the 
	hydrospanners over; they fall into the hole]
Mike: OW!
Tom: Sorry, Mike! You okay?
Mike: [exits hole, holding a hand to head] I think I need an ice pack.
	Oh, hi everybody. Welcome to the Satellite of Love. I'm Mike 
	Nelson, here with my trusty mechanic's aid Tom Servo. In case 
	you're wondering what's going on, we've just spent a week 
	providing general maintenance care for the Satellite. You know, 
	we love it so much we wear away at it, so every so often we 
	have to maintain it.
Tom: Mike, I hate to intrude on your exposition, but I'd like to know 
	if you've seen Crow.
Mike: Nope. I checked around last night. Couldn't find him. I hope 
	he's okay.
Tom: He's fine. He's just trying to get out of his fair share of the work.
Mike: Well, I'll just ask Gypsy to find him when she finishes the 
	diagnostics and frees up her brain a little. She can track him on
	the sensors.
Tom: Just so long as I get a piece of him. I've had to work for two, and
	I don't even have any functional arms.
[the lights brighten]
Mike: Hey! That must mean Gypsy finished the diagnostics!
Tom: All right! Now we can ask her where - oh, my God, Mike! Look!
[Crow staggers in stage left. He has obviously suffered great strain]
Crow: Free... at... last! [he collapses]
Tom: Crow! Crow! Speak to me!
Mike: I wonder if Gypsy knows what happened. Hang on, we'll be right back.
[hits the button, runs off]

<commercial break>

<SOL>

Tom: Crow! Crow! Are you okay?
Crow: Ooooh...
Tom: C'mon Crow, don't chicken out! Stay with me, pal! You've never
	run away from anything in your life, so FIGHT, dammit! FIGHT!
Crow: Head - hurts - pain...
Tom: Just take it easy! Mike and Gypsy'll be here soon.
Crow: No! Not Gypsy! It's all... her... fault.
Tom: What do you mean?
[Enter Mike and Gypsy. Mike is holding an ice pack to his head.]
Mike: Crow, howya doing?
Gypsy: [to Crow] How was the movie?
Crow: Get away from me. I - I - ugh! [he suffers a seizure]
Mike: Maybe this'll help. [he tosses his ice pack into the thing on 
	Crow's head. Crow stops convulsing and lies still.]
Tom: He said it was Gypsy's fault.
Gypsy: Oooooooohhhhh!!!
Mike: Calm down, Gypsy. It's okay. What happened?
Gypsy: Well, a week ago...
Tom & Mike: Uh-huh...
Gypsy: Crow asked me to do him a favor.
Tom & Mike: Uh-huh...
Gypsy: I set up the theater so he could watch "Army of Darkness..."
Tom & Mike: Uh-huh...
Gypsy: And I guess that while I was busy, the film looped...
Tom: Uh-oh.
Gypsy: So that's where he's been.
Mike: You mean...
Gypsy: He saw "Army of Darkness" a hundred and twelve times.
Tom: Hoo-boy!
Mike: A *hundred and twelve* times?
Gypsy: Give or take a dozen.
Mike: Geez. Fun is fun, but that's overkill.
Tom: [to Mike] Hey, do you think it could have any adverse effects?
[Crow moans and stirs]
Mike: I guess we'll find out. He's coming to.
[Crow regains consciousness. He looks about.]
Tom: Crow? Crow, how are you feeling?
Crow: [Ash] Groovy.
Tom: Uh-oh.
Gypsy: Crow, I'm glad you're okay.
Crow: [Ash] First you wanna kill me. Now you wanna kiss me. Blow.
Gypsy: Huh?
Crow: [Ash] Maybe I was a little harsh. [He leans over to her.]
	Gimme some sugar, baby.
Gypsy: [looks very confused. She looks at Mike, then Tom. Then:] 
	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! [Gypsy turns tail and runs]
Mike: Crow, just try to stay calm.
Crow: [Ash] What, do you want some? Huh? You want a little? 
	[to Tom] Maybe *you* want some!
Tom: [backing off] Now, listen, Crow -
[light flashes]
Mike: Cool it for a second, you two. The Deadites are calling. 
[Mike hits the button]

<Deep 13>
Dr. F: Well, Madagascar, I see you've been busy this week. I suppose 
	you're going to ask for an extension on your invention exchange.

Mike: Actually, I managed to get a few minutes to work on it here and there.

Dr. F: Oh. Uh, well, why don't you go first?

Mike: Okay. My invention is called the Highlander Upgrade. [He holds up 
	an electronic component] It's based on the beard stubble of 
	Christopher Lambert's character in the movie "Highlander."
Tom: Don't forget "Highlander 2."
Mike: I wish I could, Tom. Anyhow, something that's really weird 
	about the movie is his facial hair. He was able to keep himself 
	clean-shaven in the fourteenth century, when people shaved with 
	knives, but in the 1980s, when he had access to electric razors, 
	and safety razors, he grew really ugly beard stubble.
Tom: As technology got more advanced, he grew incapable of using it.
Mike: Right.
Crow: [Ash] Simple primitive couldn't even handle a boom-stick!
Mike: Yeah, basically, Crow. The Highlander Upgrade gives your computer 
	the same capability. It just screws around with your computer, so
	that the faster and better your computer gets, the less you can do
	with it.
[pause]
Tom: Mike, I can't believe you came up with that.
Mike: It's pretty cool, actually. I just haven't got all the bugs 
	worked out. For example, if you disconnect your hard drive, 
	you get a really huge power surge.
Crow: [Ash] Shop smart - shop S mart!
Mike: Your turn, sirs!

[Frank can be seen in the background playing with the Ratliffer]
Dr. F: On quite the Highlander kick lately, aren't we, Macleod? 
	Well, we seem to be on the same wavelength. My invention is
	also based on "Highlander." I call it the Quickener. [He holds up
	a device that looks like a plastic toy sword with a button on the 
	hilt.] Remember looking at the Quickenings and saying to yourself, 
	"I wish *I* could do that?" Well, now you can. All you do is push
	this button and you get an instant Quickening in the comfort of 
	your own home.  Here, allow me to demonstrate. 

[He activates it. Nothing happens at first. Then Dr. F stiffens and
drops the Quickener. He shakes, then jolts. The lights in Deep 13 flicker. 
There is a loud crash, followed by several more. Tables shake, spilling
the objects they were holding onto the floor. A huge amount of 
broken glass falls from the ceiling. The Ratliffer sucks in massive 
quantities of paper and starts printing the great American novel. Several
small explosions are audible in the background.
The lights in Deep 13 go out. We hear more crashing, and there is a 
final boom.
Then silence.]

Tom: WOW!
Mike: Geez. You think they were hurt?
Crow: [Ash] It's a trick. Get an axe.

[Absolute blackness. Then a light flares up. Dr. Forrester is revealed,
holding a candle.] 
Dr. F: Heh. Guess I set it a little high. Frank? Where are you, Frank?
Frank: [in darkness] Help! I'm trapped!
Dr. F: Frank? Hang on, let me get the lights. [He walks off]
[Pause]
[The lights come on again. Frank is revealed, buried chin deep in books.]
Dr. F: [re-enters] Frank? What the devil is all this?
Frank: Steve, help me. I can't move!
Dr. F: [inspects books] My God!
Frank: [terrified] What? What?
Dr. F: You're buried under Danielle Steele novels.
Frank: AHHHH!!!!! Get me OUT! Get me OUT!!!!
Dr. F: Hang on just a moment, Frank. [turns away] Well, Magnum, your
	fanfic today is the latest work of that master of the genre...

Tom: Don't tell me.

Dr. F: The one, the only.... Stephen Ratliff!

All: AUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dr. F: I knew you'd be pleased. Send them the fanfic, Frank.
Frank: [gasps and chokes]
Dr. F: What?
Frank: Can't... move...
Dr. F: Oh, for crying out loud. [He sends the fanfic]

Tom: Oh, COME ON! This puts all the plot contrivances in "Enterprized"
	to shame! I accepted the fact that Wesley couldn't make
	a cloaking device that would cover the saucer section. I accepted
	the fact that he could make one that *would* cover the saucer 
	section of the Enterprise-C! I accepted the fact that Picard 
	would give a bunch of kids control of the Enterprise D saucer! 
	But a space station that the Cardassians can't see at all, even
	just by going around  the planet? This is too much! 
[Tom breaks down crying]

Tom: Oh please, no comedy. No Ratliffian slapstick. Mike, let's go. 
	I want to pray before the next part.
Mike: Sure, Tom. 

[they exit the theater]

[Door sequence]

<SOL, the bridge>

[Tom is on the console, Crow standing behind the console next to him. Tom's
hands are clasped in prayer, as are Crow's.]

Tom: Dear God, I know I haven't prayed for a while. I'm really sorry, 
	but I've been really busy. [clears throat] So here I am now, God. 
	I need Your help. I know that I only prayed to You when the 
	other guy made me do it before I went to bed, and I confess 
	that I've had my doubts. I admit that when I clasped my hands 
	and prayed to You, I occasionally found my thoughts 
	centering on the Creepy Girl rather than Your Glory. I'm a 
	sinner, I know - I led Mike astray that time so he'd give us 
	all the RAM chips, and I got Crow to help me try to break into
	the Grammar Flamer Sorter Dumper! I've even taken Peter 
	David's name in vain. But Lord, I promise I'll mend my evil ways.
	I'll be more diligent, more faithful! I'll think globally and act
	locally! I'll practice random kindness and senseless acts of 
	beauty.I'll never ever doubt You again as long as I live, Lord. 
	I only ask that You intervene for us here, and make the next part
	of the fanfic not so bad. Thank You.
[Tom looks meaningfully at Crow]
[pause]
Tom: CROW!
Crow: What?
Tom: Your turn.
Crow: Oh. Ok. Well, uh... [long pause] Dittos, God.
Tom: Oh, come on, Crow! You're only communicating directly to the 
	Supreme Creator of the Universe! I'm sorry, but "Dittos, God" 
	is simply *not* gonna cut it!
Crow: Ok. Ok. [pause] Mega-dittos, God.
Tom: CROW!
Mike: Crow, you might wanna try a little harder.
Crow: Oh, OK. [deep breath] God, I'll be good. Please make the fanfic 
	not suck too much. Yours truly, Crow T. Robot. 
	[to Tom and Mike] How was that?
Mike: Better, Crow, but you really need to work on it.
Tom: Hey, Mike, *you* didn't pray.
Crow: Yeah! Your turn, Mike.
Mike: Ok. [Kneels behind counter] Hello, God. This is Mike. I'd like 
	to thank you for giving me Tom and Crow, to help me take my mind
	off the pain of this *incredibly* horrible fanfic. I'd like to 
	thank you for Gypsy, who runs the satellite while we goof off. 
	So bless Tom and Crow, and Gypsy, and give us strength to see 
	us through this darkest of hours. Although the brighter
	you can make this hour, the better. That's all. Thanks, God.
[pause]
Tom: Oh, God. By the way, I'd like Peter Gabriel's CD-ROM.
Crow: *I* want "Road House," the letterboxed version, on laserdisc.
Tom: Oh yeah? Well, *I* want every Warren Zevon album on CD.
Crow: Oh, *please.* *I* want every single copy of Whitney Houston's
	rendition of "I Will Always Love You," so I can destroy them and
	make the world a brighter, finer, cleaner place.
Tom: Hah! *I* want -
Mike: GUYS! Cut it out! You're trying to make a bidding war out of 
	your prayers, and that just isn't right.
Tom: You don't think that...ulp... God would make the next part of
	 the fanfic *worse* to punish us, do you, Mike?
Mike: Oh, Tom, I don't think God works that way.
[fanfic sign flashes]
Crow: I guess we're gonna find out!
All: Oh, no! FANFIC SIGN!!!

Tom: Time to go, guys. I've got something I want to show you.

[they exit the theater]

<bridge>

[Tom is standing beside a box on the console]
Mike: So what have we got here, Tom?
Tom: [clears throat] Cambot? [music starts] Thank you, Cambot. I 
	present the limited edition "Gul's Revenge" action figures! 
	Mike, if you would be so kind?
Mike: Oh, sure.
Tom: Let's begin with the Gul Ducat figure. [Mike produces figure from
	box] What adventure fanfic would be complete without an obsessive,
	poorly drawn villain? Gul Ducat comes with a collection of Bajoran
	vases, and he'll shatter them when he gets mad! [Mike pulls out some 
	pottery and makes Gul Ducat smash the items] Ha-ha! There goes the
	saucer!
Crow: [Gul Ducat] I wish that was the Enterprise saucer! I'll get you
	yet, Marrissa, you little human female tramp you!
Tom: Gul Ducat needs a place to be villainous and ineffective, so 
	here's the Ship #7 bridge playset! [Mike pulls it out] The 
	Ship #7 bridge comes with the Cardassian helmsman action figure.
[Mike places the helsman at one of the consoles and Gul Ducat on the main
bridge]
Crow: [Gul Ducat] Faster, helmsman!
Tom: [helmsman] I can't go any faster!
Crow: [Ducat] Do you want to die?
Tom: [helmsman] Why, no!
Crow: [Gul Ducat] Then go faster! Hahahahaha!!!!!
Tom: But a villain needs a hero - so we have our heroine, Marrissa
	Floras! Combine the Marrissa figure with the Enterprise Saucer 
	bridge action playset, and throw in the rest of the kids' crew 
	for maximum fun!
[Mike discards the old playset and puts up the saucer playset. He puts
	figures into place.]
Crow: [Marrissa] War is fun!
Tom: [Jay] Marrissa, would you go out with me?
Crow: [Marrissa] I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee!
Tom: Wrong sci-fi, Mr. Crow!
Crow: Oops. Sorry!
Tom: That's okay! [he clears his throat and takes a deep breath, then
	throws himself back into his pitch with even greater fervor.]
	Marrissa isn't alone in her fight! She has allies! 
	There's the cloaked "Enterprise D!" 
Mike: [hunting in box] Where?
Tom: And there's the Roanoke bridge playset! It come with the Mike 
	Walsky and Captain James Szustakowski action figures! It's got 
	some really nifty special features, too...
[Mike sets up the bridge during Tom's speech]
Crow: [Szustakowski] Prepare to attack!
[Bridge panel blows up]
Tom: Yes, it's got the blow-up bridge panel! Mike, push the switch 
	there, on the side of the figure...
	[Mike pushes the switch; metal shards pop out of Szustakowski's
	 back]
Crow: Cool!
Tom: Yes, Captain Szustakowski has metal shards imbedded in his back!
	For added realism, just squeeze his sides together... [Mike does;
	 a jet of blood squirts out] and you can use the nifty arterial 
	spray feature!
Mike: Yuck!
Tom: Don't worry, Mike, it's just ketchup.
Crow: [Walsky] Sir, you're bleeding!
Tom: [Szustakowski] I know, you fool!
Mike: Tom, wrap it up...
Tom: There's so much more! [As he speaks, Mike takes figures from 
	the box and throws them over his shoulder] The Lt. Cathy 
	Szustakowski figure, with the nary-a-dry-eye feature! 
	[Mike squeezes figure, the eyes squirt copious quantities 
	of water.] The commander of all Cardassian forces! The 
	Melaine Morris figure, with black evening dress! [Crow 
	wolf-whistles] Captain Selv, with elf costume! The 
	fun never stops!
Mike: What do you think, sirs?

<Deep 13>
Dr. F: [writing on clipboard] "Arterial spray feature..." Frank,
	we'll make a fortune selling those! It's dino-damage taken
	to its logical extreme!
Frank: I want the Ship #7 action playset.
Dr. F: If you're a good Frank.
Frank: I'll be good!
Dr. F: You can start by pushing the button.
[Frank runs over and pushes the button.]
[Fade out]
Frank: [voice over] But I don't *want* to eat my Brussels sprouts!

Credits:

The original fanfic "A Gul's Revenge" was written (if that's the word)
by Stephen Ratliff, of Radford University. It's all his fault.
The MiSTing of the fanfic is by David Hines.
"Mystery Science Theater 3000"  and all related characters
are the property of Best Brains.
"Star Trek: the Next Generation" and "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" 
belong to Paramount.
"Highlander" is copyrighted and trademarked, but I don't know who
holds those copyrights.
"Army of Darkness," directed by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell,
is an absofreakin'lutely hilarious film. If you watch it once you'll quote 
Ash for hours. If you watch it a hundred and twelve times, your 
personality will be replaced entirely with that of Ash. Practice 
moderation. Think about it, won't you? Thank you.
Peter David was only mentioned once in this post, and no demeaning
remarks about him or any of his works is contained herein, in
compliance with MiSTing regulation #3765.01-25.
This posting is not a personal attack on Stephen Ratliff. All jokes 
about him made by the characters in this posting are just that - jokes. 
I have never met Mr. Ratliff, and have no reason to hold a grudge 
against him. Anything he tells you about a bad deal down in Mexico 
is a filthy lie. 
The "Gul's Revenge" action figures are coming soon to a fine toy store
near you.
