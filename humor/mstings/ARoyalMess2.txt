Magic Voice: Previously, on "MUT3K"...

[Cambot scrolls Suzanne Schroeder's MSTing of the first half of "A Royal
 Mess" up the screen *very* quickly.  The entire 75K text file zooms by 
 from start to finish in about five seconds.]

Magic Voice: There!  Now that you've all been brought up to speed, please
             enjoy the conclusion of Stephen Ratliff's "A Royal Mess".
             We now return you to our regularly scheduled host segment,
             already in progress....

[Dissolve to...]

[SOL]

[The Bridge is dark and deserted.  A makeshift barricade, consisting 
 of boxes and other random pieces of furniture, has been erected
 in front of the theater doors.  Boards have been nailed across
 the Hexfield.  Off in the distance, sounds of activity can be
 heard.]

Tom : [O.S.] Quick!  I need that rivet gun over here!  Stat!
Mike: [O.S.] They're getting closer!
Tom : [O.S.] I'm evacuating the mess hall!
Crow: [O.S.] Wierzbowski!?  Wierzbowski!?
Mike: [O.S.] Where's Apone?
Tom : [O.S.] The sarge is dead, man!  Let's get the %^#@ out
             of here!

[Gypsy enters.]
Gypsy: Hi everyone!

[Tom dashes in.]
Tom : Mike!  I can't hold them off much longer!
Mike: [O.S.] Keep trying!
[Tom dashes out of view.]

Gypsy:  Welcome back to the Satellite of Love!  Things are a 
        bit hectic around here today.

[Crow rushes onto the Bridge.]
Crow: They've broken through the security perimeter!  Take 
      cover, everyone!  AIIIIIIEEEEEE!!!!!

[Crow exits, screaming.]

Gypsy: It seems that a nasty rumor got started back on Earth 
       that, well, Cambot was that thing that holds Pokemon....

[Throngs of normal looking people rush onto the Bridge.  Instantly,
 they begin to overturn things, frantically looking for something.
 They start to shake Cambot, causing the picture to shake also.]

Gypsy: ... well, you can see what happened.
Voice: Where are they?!
Voice 2: They've got to be around here somewhere!
Voice 3: Got to catch them all!  Got!  To!  Catch!  Them!  All!
Voice 4: Hey!  There's a new breed of them over here!
Crow: [O.S.] Ahhh!!!  Keep away from me!
Voice 4: Awww!  Listen to it!  It almost sounds like it's
         really saying words!
Voice 5: And this one looks like a gumball machine!
Tom : [O.S.]  Nooo!  I'll cut you!  I swear that I will!

[A harried woman, looking remarkably like Bridget Jones, rushes 
 over to Gypsy.]
Bridget: Hey!  Maybe there's more of them inside this purple 
         hamper thing!

[Bridget begins to try to pry open Gypsy's mouth.  Suddenly 
 shotgun blasts can be heard offstage.  The crowd quickly scatters.
 Mike enters moments later, brandishing a shotgun.  He continues 
 to fire as he speaks.]

Mike: I [blam!] told [blam!] you [blam!] we [blam!] don't [blam!] 
     have [blam!] any [blam!] of those [blam!] damn [blam!]
     Pokemon [blam!] here! [blam!]

[Mike lowers the shotgun.  Crow and Servo quickly pop up behind him.]
Mike: See?  And you two thought that my playing Doom was just 
      a big waste of time. [He turns to the camera.]  We'll be right 
      back. 
[Mike hits the flashing commercial light and the planet logo appears.]
Mike: [O.S.] Yeah!  Who's da man?!
Crow: [O.S.] Calm down, Mike.

[Commercial.]

[Slowly, white words begin to form on a featureless black screen...]

Coming soon, a collaboration of two of the most creative minds on the 
planet.

An epic piece of work from the minds of the creator of Cats, Joseph and
the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Phantom of 
the Opera, and the creator of the acclaimed Star Trek: The Next Generation 
spin-off, "The Marrissa Stories."

[The blackness disappears and we can see throngs of cheering Federation 
 citizens, all singing...]

Crowd: Ma-rris-sa!
       Ma-rris-sa!
       Ma-rris-sa!
       Ma-rris-sa!

It's Andrew Lloyd Weber and Stephen Ratliff's "Marrissa!"

[Marrissa, clad in an admiral's uniform, steps onto a raised podium.
 Beside her is her husband, Jay Gordon.  The crowd cheers wildly.  She 
 steps to the microphone and begins to sing.]

Marrissa: "Don't cry for me, Federation..."

Coming soon.

[SOL]

[The bots are busily cleaning up the mess left by the throng of maddened 
 shoppers.  Mike stands in the back, strutting around proudly.]

Crow: [to Tom] You know, Cambot does look like that dispenser thing....
Mike: Yeah.  I came.  I saw.  I kicked their collective asses!  Woo-hoo!
Tom : Mike, can you tone it down a bit?
Crow: Yeah, we're glad that you saved us and all, but jeez, you don't
      have to rub our noses in it.
Mike: I have become death, destroyer of worlds, and protector of Cambot!
Tom : Well, you've got the "destroyer of worlds" part down pat.
Mike: Hey!
[The Mads light on the console begins to flash.]
Crow: Mike?  Tickle-me Pearl, Bobo, and Observer are calling.
Mike: Oh, all right.  [Mike hits the light.]  Mike Nelson, Galactic Hero 
      speaking.

[Castle Forrester]

[The Castle is festively decorated for Easter.  Lilies, colored eggs and 
 wicker baskets filled with plastic grass are everywhere.  Cases of 
 Peeps (R), those tasty, edible marshmallow chickens, are stacked in the 
 background.  Pearl stands in the foreground, dressed in her usual outfit.  
 A displeased Observer stands behind her, wearing a pair of bunny rabbit 
 ears.  His brain also wears a pair of ears.  Bobo wanders about in the 
 background, occasionally stooping down to pick up an egg and put it in 
 his Easter basket.]

Pearl: Easter greetings, Nelson!  We've got a really, eggs-tra special 
       treat for you today....

[SOL]

Crow: You'll be showing us a super chunk of old "Speed Buggy" cartoons?

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: Um, no.  It seems that you three have some unfinished business 
       to take care of.  I'll let Bobo explain....

[Bobo steps into view, carrying a thick sheaf of paper.]

Bobo: Hi Mike!  You see, my story begins when the Lawgiver sent me
      out to search for Easter eggs.  You know, I never knew how 
      enjoyable an activity that was!  I've been hunting and searching
      and hunting and searching and hunting and searching for quite some 
      time now, and I feel greatly refeshed.  It's almost as if I've 
      regressed to the presentient days of gorilla-dom!  Well, except 
      I'm not wearing a tutu and riding a tricycle.  Perhaps I should 
      write up an article for the journals....
Pearl: [interrupting] Get to the point!
Bobo: Oh.  Right.  Anyway, I was searching in the basement, and
      beneath this lovely speckled blue egg, I found a most
      interesting story.  [Mumbling]  Then I found someone's head.
      It had a spit curl on it, of all things...

[Pearl interrupts again.]
Pearl: You see, Mikey, my beloved Clayton left behind an unfinished 
       story...
Observer: Pearl, I don't mean to interrupt, but must I wear these
          accursed ears?
Pearl: Brain Guy.  We had a deal.  You wear the ears, I give you
       the peeps.  Remember?  Now do you want those delicious 
       marshmallow chickens or not?
Observer: Yes, ma'am.
Pearl: Then you wear the ears, got it?  Anyway, Mike.  It seems that 
       you began to watch this thing, and then you stopped halfway 
       through it....

[SOL]

Tom : Oh no.  There aren't even *more* Master Ninja films, are there?
Mike: What?
Crow: We'll tell you later.

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: No, no, no.  It's even worse.  It's a story by one of your 
       *favorite* authors. 
Observer: I believe that his name is, oh, what was it...?  Pearl, 
          do you remember who wrote this?
Pearl: [Grinning evilly] Why, yes.  Yes I do.  I believe that it
       was a Mister Stephen Ratliff.

[SOL]

[The crew looks stunned.  After a moment, Mike gulps and speaks.]

Mike: Well, we've survived Ratliff before.  Heck, some of his recent 
      stuff is pretty good.

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: Well, that may be the case, but this *isn't* a recent story.
       It's a vintage *1995* Ratliff story.

[SOL]

[Mike has gone pale.  The bots' jaws are hanging open.]

Crow: Oh.  My.  God.
Tom : What did we do to deserve this?
Mike: Pearl, you inhuman monster!

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: That's right, Mike.  Prepare yourself for the *second* half
       of Stephen Ratliff's "A Royal Mess"....

[SOL]

Mike: Er, wait a minute.  I don't remember a first half to this one.

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: You don't?  You must have.  You've read all of these...

[SOL]

Crow: Wait a minute, Mike.  I remember this one.  Joel was in 
      the theater on this one.  You were trapped in Limboland.
Tom : You mentioned something about talking to a skeleton....
Crow: Remember?  This was just after Gypsy and Tom flushed your 
      underwear out the airlock?
Tom : Crow!
Mike: Oh yeah. [pause] Well, can you fill me in?
Crow: I think so.  It inexplicably starts out with the Epilogue.
      Marrissa does some paperwork.
Tom : Then Chromedome wanders in and babbles for a while.
Crow: Then the story begins anew.
Tom : The Royal Family of Essex decides to get some pizza.
Crow: They all die in an explosion, except for Vicky, the
      activities director.
Tom : Riker and Marrissa play "Speed Racer" on the holodeck.
Crow: Meanwhile, the Prime Minister arrives to comfort poor,
      grief-stricken Vicky.
Tom : Then Romulans seize control of *another* starship.
Crow: Except the valiant Kid's Crew of the ship escape the 
      Romulan's grasp.
Tom : Again.
Crow: Marrissa shows Jean-Luc and Beverly around a ship that
      they've lived on for years.
Tom : Then Admiral Yrev Tpurroc calls, but he doesn't use
      10-10-321.
Crow: Vroom!  Off goes the Enterprise to Essex.  After all, 
      they'll do a much better job at investigating a murder 
      than the police will.
Tom : Parliament babbles a bit about something or another.
Crow: Then Parliament blows up too.
Tom : We suspect a Ford Pinto was involved.
Crow: Marrissa then browbeats her henchmen for a while.
Tom : Then Vicky shows up on the Enterprise looking for 
      Isaac and Gopher.
Crow: Marrissa is ordered to run a security drill to continue 
      her reign of terror on the crew.
Tom : Jay Gordon wanders around the holodeck for a bit.
Crow: And then Data and Geordi have to dress up like women
      so that they can get an apartment.
Tom : See?  It's all very simple.
Mike: So it's a normal Marrissa story then.
Crow: Yep.
Mike: Okay. [He turns towards the screen.] All right, Pearl,
      do your worst.

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: It's your funeral, Mike.  Here it comes... "A Royal Mess, Part
       Two."  Now start hopping down the bunny trail and get into that
       theater!  Brain Guy, send it to them.
Observer: Gladly.

[Cue sound as Observer uses that brain voodoo that he do so well to
 send the fanfic.]

[SOL]

[Lights flash, buzzers buzz and pandemonium erupts.]

Mike: AHHH!!!!  WE'VE GOT LONG DELAYED RATLIFF SIGN!!!!!  AHHHHH!!!!!!!!

[Theater]

[Mike, Tom and Crow enter and sit down.]

Mike: So, three years to get to this point, huh?
Tom : Yep.
Mike: This is going to hurt, isn't it?
Crow: Uh-huh.

>Chapter Five

Mike: ...and let Samson, Powers and Welles help *you* with your Chapter
      Five filing.

>        Normally Lieutenant Commander Worf commanded Beta shift.

Tom: He usually commanded it to "SLEEEEEEEEEPPPP!!!".

>However he was busy on the planet supervising the gathering of
>evidence on the planet's surface,

Mike: ...planting the occasional bloody glove here and there.

>                                  so Lieutenant junior grade Ross
>Lockard,

Crow: a.k.a. "The suck up"

>         the normal Beta shift tactical officer, was in command as
>senior officer on the bridge.  "Worf to the bridge," came the Security 
>Chief's voice.

Tom: At the bridge, Riker will play us through and then Data will
      launch into the chorus, okay?

>        "Yes, Commander," Ross replied.
>        "Begin drill Saboteur one," Worf said.  "Reminder: no phasers are
>to be used.  Worf out."

Mike: (as Worf) You are restricted to wedgies and sissy slap-fighting.

>        "Just great, I bet Marrissa is behind this," Ross muttered.

Crow: (as Ross) But I totally approve!  How brilliant!

>        Then the tactical officer, Ensign Henderson announced, 

Tom: (as Henderson) If I see that blasted "Yo quiero Taco Bell" dog again,
      I'm going to go postal!
Mike: (as Ross) Okay.  Thanks for sharing.  Anyone else?
Crow: (as Navigation) I'm tired of seeing all of those psychic hotline ads.
Mike: (as Ross) Great!  We're making real progress here, people!

>                                                               "the
>lights on decks 3,4,5,6, and 7 just went out."

Tom: Those wacky engineers cross-circuited life support and the staff
     Christmas tree again!

>        Ross Lockard moved his had toward

Crow: Say!

>                                          the control on the Captain's
>chair which controlled Engineering.

Crow: Rats!
Mike: Crow, you don't really want a Marrissa lemon, do you?
Crow: Eeewww... good point, Mike.
Tom: Last time he touched Marrissa's hinder, a whole ship full of aliens
     died because of it.

>                                     "I wouldn't do that if I were you," a
>voice familiar to Lieutenant Lockard said.

Mike: (as Ross) How'd the voice of "Naughty Nancy" get in here?

>                                            He drew back his finger
>instinctively.  "Why?" asked the Lieutenant.  

Crow: (as Ren Hoek) *BECAUSE IT'S THE HISTORY ERASER BUTTON, YOU FOOL!!!*

>                                                 There was no response so 
>Ross again moved his finger toward the button.

Crow: (as you-know-who) Push the button, Frank.
Mike: Crow, face it.  He's gone.

>         "I wouldn't do that if I were you," the voice said again.

Tom: (as HAL) Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?

>        Ross Lockard withdrew again.  Then getting up his courage once
>again his finger approached the button.

Mike: (as Cowardly Lion) Courage!

>        "I wouldn't do that if I were you," the voice said a third
>time.

Crow: The story that unabashedly repeats itself.

>        Ross pressed the button.  

Tom: (as Ross) Ha!  See this, disembodied voice?!  I'm pressing the
      *HELL* out of this button!
[A noise like "Fwoosh" is heard as the image on the screen contracts to 
 a single point, surrounded by darkness.]
Mike: [O.S.] Hah, hah.  Very funny.  Turn the screen back on, please.
Tom: [O.S.] I don't know if that's a good idea....
Crow: [O.S.] Yeah, sitting in the dark might be preferable to continuing
      on with this story.
Tom: [O.S.] I mean, it has taken us three years to get to this point....
Mike: [O.S.] We're getting this over with.  I am not going to have this
      story hanging over my head for another three years!
Tom: [O.S.] All right, all right.  Turn the screen back on!
[A click is heard and the image of Mike and the Bots and the theater 
 slowly fades back into view.]
Mike: Okay Ratliff.  Do your worst.

>                                    A large quantity of strawberry juice
>materialized above the Lieutenant.

Crow: The weird part is that Marrissa actually set that up for herself....
Tom: (as Ross, looking up) Huh.  Wonder what's keeping that juice
      from falling?  Oh well...

>                                    The voice said, "I told you not to
>do that."

Mike: And Lieutenant Commander Screwy Squirrel earns a formal reprimand.

>          The wet and sticky Lieutenant

All: Eeewwww!!

>                                         got up and moved toward the door

Crow: ... to start a bloody rampage throughout the ship as he realized
      that what he was actually soaked in was pig's blood.

>to the head.  He moved his hand to touch the control which opened the
>door.  "I wouldn't do that either," the voice continued, 

Tom: (as Ross) Well, geez, what *would* you do if you were me?!

>                                                          "At least not 
>until you get someone to start looking for me and finding everything I 
>have disabled."

Mike: Boy, God is just out to *get* Ross today, isn't he?

>        "Ensign Henderson, you have the bridge while I clean up,"

Tom: Henderson?  Mr. Kegger himself?  Woo-hoo!  Party!

>                                                                  Ross
>said.  "Contact Engineering and have them do something about those lights.  

Mike: (as Ross) Have them pass around candles or something.

>Start a search for the Saboteur." 

Crow: (as Henderson) Sir?  I'm getting approximately 244,562 hits on that
       word from Yahoo.
Mike: (as Ross) Damn.  Try Hotbot then.  But stay away from Webcrawler!

>                                   Ross pressed the button to open the door, 
>only to find he faced a wall of water.  

Tom: And Wonder Twin Zan stops by to help out!

>                                        The force field holding it back 
>released and Ross was sprayed with kiloliters of water.

Mike: That's good, Marrissa, just spew hundreds of gallons of water
      into a vital area of the ship with sensitive circuitry
      everywhere.  I'm sure nothing could go wrong.

>        "Get someone to clean up this mess," Ross ordered walking across
>the bridge.  

Crow: *snort*  "Walking"?  How about *"wading"*?  Ever see *one* kiloliter
      of water before, Steve?
Tom: Oh, and by the way, the water shorted out phaser control, opening 
     fire and wiping out the entire planet.  Better send a condolence card.
Mike: At least it wasn't me this time.

>               "One bath towel," he said as he reached the replicator.

Tom: (as voice) I wouldn't do that if I were you....
Mike: You sass that hoopy Ross Lockard?  There's a frood who knows where 
      his towel is.

>
>        Meanwhile Marrissa and her friend were having fun.  

Crow: And, in the world according to Ratliff, that's all that matters.

>                                                            "Clara tell
>me how can I get the heat detection grid off-line," Marrissa asked.  

Tom: (as Marrissa) I want to see how many fires we can start....

>"Without the bridge knowing, please."
>        "Deck Five Section Seven Alpha, Jefferies tube 27,"

Mike: Ooh.  Right in the stylish section of the Jefferies tubes!

>                                                            Clara
>replied.  "Replace chip 34 in the sensor access panel with a repeater 
>chip. It will look like a chip failure only after about five to
>ten minutes."

Crow: Darn foreign imports!
Tom: Olestra -- for all your chip failures!

>        "Shayna replace that chip," Marrissa ordered.  

Mike: (as Shayna) Is that a ZIF socket or do I need to dig out
       the chip puller?

>                                                        "Alexander, delay

Crow: (as Marrissa) Go down there and tell them there's snakes in the

>want every senior officer on board breathing down Lieutenant Lockard neck, 
>but I don't want them on the bridge."

Tom: (as Marrissa) Why, if we let them up there, adults might solve their
      own problems!

>        "I can do that if you take out the turbolifts to the bridge,"

Mike: (as Marrissa) That way, we can have a nice big elevator shaft by the 
       Bridge.  It'll add a certain touch of class to the place!

>Clara replied.
>        "Already done, Lieutenant Lockard will be begging for a transfer
>when I am done," Marrissa grinned wickedly.

Tom: (as Marrissa) Now, if I can just do this to every senior member of the 
      crew, then the Enterprise will be mine!  BWAH-HA-HA!!!!
Crow: All she needs now is some white-face makeup and she could be the
      new clown prince of crime.

>        "I thought you liked Ross," Clara commented.

Mike: She does.  That's the scary part.

>        "I do but he called me Risa last night and very few get away
>with that," Marrissa replied. 

Tom: (as Marrissa) He's lucky I'm letting him live.

>                              "I just added the Doctor to that list and 

Crow: (as Marrissa) ... I get to call her "Snugglecakes" in exchange. 

>I don't intend to add anyone to that list for quite some time,

Mike: I wonder if *we're* on that list....

Tom: We gotta take our show to Broadway!

>                We've got some adults to fool."

Mike: Like that's any challenge in Ratliff's world.
Crow: (as Homer Simpson) You couldn't fool me on the foolingest day of your 
       life if you had an electrified fooling machine!

>        After taking care of a couple systems, Marrissa wandered over to

>opening as they did in an unoccupied suite they announced her presence.  

Tom: In other words, she bopped her nose on the door.

>"Great, I arrange a meeting place and Data assigns someone to the room a 
>couple minutes later," Marrissa muttered.  "Well, it would be impolite to 
>runaway after ringing the doorbell."

Mike: At least before throwing the eggs and T.P.'ing the potted plants,
      I guess.
Crow: Okay, so she douses her friend with strawberry juice just before
      turning the bridge into an aquarium, but *now* she's worried about 
      being impolite.  Got it.

>Taking a brief appraisal of the girl at the door she said, 

Tom: (as Victoria) GUARDS!  *SHOOT TO KILL*!!!

Mike: Ooh, he checked his Nitpicker's Guide To Stephen Ratliff before 
      writing this.
Crow: I can't imagine that book sold more than maybe 93 copies.
Tom: I thought what we do was the Nitpicker's Guide to Ratliff.

Mike: (as Marrissa) Basically, I carved my entire gospel on there.

Mike: Let's hear it for the new Commander-In-Chief of Essex's military!

>        "Right," Marrissa replied.
>        "That explains it.  I had the two mixed up,"

Crow: Right.
Tom: So, then, port is left?
Crow: Right.
Tom: Port is right?
Crow: No.  Remember, the first thing you pick, port, is left.
Tom: So after that...
Crow: After that option's gone, starboard is left.
Tom: Which is right.
Crow: Right!
Tom: Which one's that?
Mike: The, uh, starboard sketch, ladies and gentlemen.

Mike: (as Marrissa) ... I doubt that anyone will ever take you seriously

Tom: In the future, Queens will be nerds!
Mike: Sure!  Why not?  She's royalty.  The only demands on her day are
      opening a shopping mall, and shooting documentaries on architecture
      for PBS.
Crow: Note, it's the *Cochrane* Journal of Engineering, because scientific
      history will go for 400 years with exactly *one* significant name.

Tom: (as Marrissa) Oh, he was too busy ogling me in my swimsuit, like all
      the rabble.
Mike: Clara, try to understand... *nobody* reads junk mail!
Crow: But you'd think that Geordi's lack of a love life would give him lots
      of free time to catch up on his reading.

Tom: (falsetto) This is your captain, Fergie, speaking.  Our crusing
        altitude today will be...
Mike: (as Victoria) ... until word got out that I couldn't tell my
        "port" from my "starboard".  Nobody wanted to hire me after that
        for some reason.

>        "Remember who did read your article, Clara," Shayna reminded.

Tom: (as Clara) Well, there was that Bolian barber, a couple guys named
      Steve and Frank, Professors Howard, Fine and Howard and that
      charming Ted Kaczynski person.

>        "Counselor Troi, of all people, the only one who reads it,"
>Clara said.  "I still can't figure out why her."

Crow: Oh.  Here we go.  "The Cochrane Journal of Engineering: An 
      Engineering Magazine for the Superfluous Personnel on a Starship."
Tom: Well, with Marrissa around, the entire bridge crew should be 
     reading it.
Mike: Knowing Troi, I'm guessing she likes the pretty pictures.

>        "I can, she wants to know ahead of time when you are going to

Crow: There's a reminder for you, just in case that you've forgotten
      that the Kid's Crew are heads and shoulders above every other
      person in Starfleet.
Tom: Didn't Troi already explain this to Clara back in "Away From Home"?

>        "It seems that you have quite a crew," Victoria said.  "Are they

Mike: (as Marrissa) They're pretty rock stupid actually.  It's me, I tell
       you, me!

Crow: Other languages use *words* instead of Treknobabble.  Who knew?

All: [gasp]
Crow: Mike--did she... did she just admit an inadequacy?  Hold me.  I'm 
      scared. 
Mike: Me too.  Hold me, Tom. 
Tom: I'm scared too!  Hold me, um... um... oh, skip it.

Crow: I must?  Well, if you insist, Your Goofiness...

>        "No he is the Chief of Operations and Second Officer, Alexander

Tom: (as Alexander) Oh, the Klingon ALWAYS has to be Security.  Racist pig!

Mike: Ladies and Gentlemen, Queen Victoria Ray Jay Johnson of Essex!

>        "What should we call you?" Alexander said to the Queen.

Crow: Call her Dave!  I dare ya!

>        "Just Victoria please," the Queen replied.

Tom: (as Alexander) Hi there, Just Victoria!

Mike: (as Marrissa) Of course, she also giggled wildly whenever anyone said

        own blood!
Crow: (as Riker) Worf, that's what you said last night when Ten-Forward
        ran out of prune juice.
Tom: (as Picard) Yeah.  You're really uptight these days.  Why don't you
        head back to DS9 and visit that Trill that... you're... whoops.

Crow: (as LaForge) Or maybe strontium chromate.  Or maybe monosodium
        glutamate.  Or--okay, you caught me.  I've been making all this
        stuff up for the last ten years.
Tom: C'mon!  It's Ratliff!  We know it's either the Romulans, the 
        Cardassians, the "anti-Starfleetites", the junior jumble Balkan

Mike: Servo?  Crow?  We've got commercial sign!

Magic Voice: I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Magic Voice: I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Mike: Oh.  It's like the story.  Cute.  Gosh!  I

 from the ceiling, six feet from Mike.]

Tom: [O.S.] D'oh!

[Crow enters the bridge.]

Crow: Mike?  We're having a bit of a problem with the 
      dispensing system.  Can you try it again?
Mike: Sure, I guess.
Crow: Good.  Take two!

[Crow exits.]

Mike: Gosh!  I sure hope that nothing bad happens!

[Mike hits the light again.  Another flood of red
 liquid falls directly in front of the camera.  
 Mike is unaffected.]

Crow: [O.S.] Cambot!

Crow: [O.S.] Hey, you were manning the controls!
Tom : [O.S.] Mike?  Can you try it again?
Mike: Sure. [flatly] Gosh.  I sure hope nothing

 strawberry juice drips down from the ceiling,
 about a foot away from Mike.]

Crow: [O.S.] Oh, that's just great!  Not only
      are we off target, but we're out of juice!
Tom : [O.S.] Let's go to Plan B then.  Get the 
      ping-pong balls.
Mike: Ping-pong balls?

[Right on cue, thousands of ping-pong balls fall 
 on Mike.  As the balls continue to fall, the bots
 begin to speak.]

Crow: [O.S.] That's not as funny as I hoped it would be.
Tom : [O.S.] You're right.  The peeps then?
Mike: Peeps?  What are...

[Mike's words are lost as thousands of marshmallow
 chickens fall from above.]

Crow: [O.S.] Hmm.  No, that doesn't really work either.
Tom : [O.S.] Okay, let's go with the watermelons.
Mike: What?! 

[Mike yelps in surprise and dives for cover as 
 watermelons fall from the ceiling.]

Crow: [O.S.] Not that one either.
Tom : [O.S.] Cue the fire axes!
Mike: [still under the counter] Noo!!! 

[He darts up and hits the commercial sign light.
 While the planet logo is on the screen, screams
 and sounds of heavy pieces of metal hitting the 
 floor can be heard.]

[Commercial.]

One junior executive gumball machine: $19.95

One lacrosse mask: $29.95

One purple child car seat: $53

One jumpsuit: $40

Listening to Mike berate the bots:
"Crow!!!!!"
Priceless.

Crow: Romulans have a moral code against taking footwear in the
        Ratliffverse.  It shows up again in "Unto the Next Generation".
Tom: You remember these things?
Crow: I've asked Mike to disconnect my memory module, but no....

        would, um, make it possible for their... prisoners... to... escape.

Mike: Be brave, little toaster.

Tom: And whoever is surprised, raise your hand.

Mike: (as Marrissa) Both my feet.  I had to put them somewhere.

Mike: Thank you.
Tom: Also the 1907 launch of the U.S. Navy's "Chester," the world's

Mike: That's... fascinating.  Thank you.

Mike: The two hours is so they can turn into lizards and mate with each
        other.

>        "I assume you heard that?" Jay asked.
>        "Yes, Admiral Picard will expect you then," Riker responded.

Crow: (as Riker) You will be allowed to have Cap'n Crunch, and eat it out 
        of the blue bowl when you arrive.

Tom: (as Jay) Yeah, it was a nasty transporter accident with Yakky Doodle,
        but we got it all straightened out.

>        "Yes, but Marrissa was the bug in mine," Jay responded.

Mike: (as Jay) She threatened to lay her eggs in my brain if I didn't 
        get her dad a promotion.  It was creepy.

>"Independence out."

Crow: Mike, the imagery here is not helping me.
Mike: Let's take a break.

[They get up and exit the theater.]

[Commercials.]

[SOL]

[The bridge of the Satellite of Love is teeming with activity.
 Tom and Crow stand behind the command console.  In between 
 the pair stand Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie.  Peppy music 
 plays in the background, and the quartet is bobbing up and
 down in time with the music.]

Crow: o/~ Hey there, everybody!
      We're stuck up here in space!
      Forced to watch bad movies
      It all seems such a waste!
      Things sure could be better,
      but I'm not going to lie!
      We're still better off than that Bill Clinton guy! o/~

[Applause and cheers can be heard in the background.  Cambot's
 view switches to Ryan.]

Ryan: o/~ I'm a TV actor,
      I work on ABC.
      They pay me lots of money
      To work with Drew Car-ey.
      I don't watch bad movies,
      But my fate's even worse...
      Drew likes to act in the nude, whenever we rehearse! o/~

[The crowd cheers wildly.  Cambot switches to Drew, who's
 blushing furiously.  Cambot switches back to Colin.]

Colin: o/~ Here are these two robots,
       I guess they're out of luck.
       You could feel kind of sorry 
       For Fireplug and Spider-Duck.
       Seeing these bad movies
       Must really, really suck.
 	 But I don't have to watch them, so I don't give a 
          flying... leap. o/~

[The crowd hoots and hollers.  Mike enters from the right
 side of the bridge with a confused expression on his face.]

Mike: Guys?  What's going on here?

Tom: o/~ Hey, Mike, I've got a secret,
     So promise you won't tell.
     The friendly folks from "Whose Line"
     Have come to visit for a spell.
     As you can see, it looks like Drew
     Has "Hoedown" on the brain.
     But it keeps us out of the theater, so I really can't 
	  complain! o/~

[More applause.  Music continues under.]

Mike: That's pretty neat, Tom.
Tom : Hey, grab a verse, Mike!
Crow: Yeah, join the fun.
Mike: Oh, I couldn't...
Drew: [O.S.] Oh, c'mon Nelson, don't be a party pooper.
Mike: Well, if you're sure...
All : Yeah, c'mon, you can do it, etc.

[Mike starts getting into it and bobbing up and down to the music.]

Mike: o/~ Oh, Jack Frost and Doc Thinker,
      The Final Sacrifice,
      Time Speeder and Time Chaser and
      Those Questing Delta Knights!
      You wonder how we live through all
      These dastardly attacks?
      We say to ourselves it's just a show, we should really 
	   just relax! o/~
All: REALLY JUST RELAAAAAAAAAAAAX!!!

[Thunderous applause]

Drew: That was pretty good, fellas, so I'm gonna award 7 million 
	points to Laura Hall.  [laughter, applause]  Okay, this next 
	segment is called "Props".  You'll each divide into teams of...

[Suddenly, a peeved looking Greg Proops and Wayne Brady enter.]

Greg : Drew!  
Drew : Oh, hi fellas.
Wayne: C'mon, man, fun's fun, but we got a show to do!
Drew : I'm not going back, guys!  Not even if ABC apologizes!
Tom  : For what?
Drew : They ran those stupid crawl ads for "Storm of the Century" 
	 across the bottom of the screen!  On *both* my shows!
Crow : Ouch!
Drew : Yeah, and it wasn't even a *good* Stephen King story!
Greg : Look, Drew, we know you're upset, but be reasonable.
Drew : Nope!  If the SportsNight folks can pull their show for one night,
	 I can relocate up here with my new robot buddies!  Right guys?
Crow : You betcha, Drew!
Tom  : Yeah!  We'll tell dirty jokes and drink beer all night!
Wayne: ABC's offered you more money!
Drew : Money?!?  HAH!  I laugh at their futile attempts to... how *much* 
       more?

[Greg hands him a piece of paper.]

Drew: Whoa!
Mike: How much?

[Drew passes the paper to Mike, who shows it to Ryan and Colin.]

Mike, Ryan & Colin: WHOA!
Wayne: Well, with Tim Allen leaving next year, they can dig a little 
	 deeper.
Drew: That's it.  C'mon you two, we're going.
Crow: Drew!  What about our little club?
Tom : Yeah!  We were gonna sit around and do guy stuff!
Drew: Sorry, fellas.  I'd ask you guys to come along, but, well, I think
	you kinda cheesed Colin off with that Canada song.
Tom : Huh?

[Colin sticks out his tongue as the "Whose Line Is It, Anyway?" group 
 trudges off.]

Tom : Darn it, Mike!  This is all your fault!
Mike: Mine?!?  How?
Crow: You could have met ABC's offer!
Mike: With what?!  You guys have maxed out all my credit cards! 
Tom : Yeah, and it's your fault for letting us!
Mike: Y'know, I should just forget about expecting linear thinking 
      around here. 

[Lights flash, buzzers buzz and pandemonium erupts.]

Mike: Let's go, guys!  WE GOT RATLIFF SIGN!!!

[..6..]
[..5..]
[..4..]

[Theater]

[Mike and the bots enter and sit down.]

Mike: Wow.  I didn't even know we could fit a studio audience
        on the bridge.
Crow: Oh yeah.  There's scads of room over by the jacuzzi and
        the bowling alley.

>Chapter Nine
>
>        Clara Sutter, Princess of Essex, didn't like to be confined.

Tom: The giant space hamsters who had captured her wanted her to know
        how it feels to live in a Habitrail.

>However it was for a good cause.  

Mike: She needed to be spayed and the vet insisted on an overnight stay.

>                                  She didn't want to rule this planet any
>more than Marrissa wanted to leave Starfleet.  However this didn't stop 
>her from making sure Marrissa knew her displeasure 

Crow: (whiny) My feet hurt!
Tom: (same) My ankles are swollen!
Mike: (same) My elbows are chafed!
Crow: (same) My eyes are stinging!
Tom: (same) My stomach is rumbling!
Mike: (same) My episode guide to "The Six Million Dollar Man" got water
        damaged!
Crow & Tom: Huh?

>                                                       and she wasn't exactly 
>happy that Marrissa had gotten her into this.

Crow: Clara finally gets so fed up that she challenges the notion of
        Marrissa-infallibility!

>                                               "Marrissa, why did I let you
>talk me into this?" she asked.
>        "You know why Clara," Marrissa replied.

Tom: (as Marrissa) Because I held up a shiny and tricked you into following.

>        "Yes, 'It would be a good idea to learn more about a planet we
>may have to rule,'" Clara parroted. "'Plus some fresh air would do you some
>good.'

Mike: (as Clara) ...and, still, it is more fun than that whole "Sailor
        Marrissa" thing.

>        I don't know about you but I don't classify being confined in some
>detention cell on a Trakce vessel as fresh air."

Crow: (as Marrissa) Aw, c'mon, the air here is nearly four percent oxygen!

>        "Stop sulking, Clara, like laughter, it's contagious," Marrissa
>replied.

Mike: Also like cooties.
Tom: No girlfriend in grade school, Mike?
Mike: (sulking) Um... no...
                            
>        "Yes, your royal highness," Clara replied.

Crow: (as Clara) That's right, Marrissa, I've been really, really *bad*...
Tom: Ugh... never, never do that again.
Mike: Hey, does that count as a syndrome?
Crow & Tom: Don't go there, Nelson!

>        As they completed their conversation, a couple Trakce gray
>ribbons entered the cell.  

Crow: Realizing that they were more intelligent than their wearers, the 
        hair ribbons eventually took control of the Trakce empire.

>                           "Get up," they said.  "The master wants you."

        on tHe SuPeR bOwL.  DaMN BrOnCoS...
Tom: Unfortunately, being only ribbons, the Trakce couldn't enforce
        their demands.

>
>        Meanwhile on the Bridge of the Enterprise, Worf announced, "They
>have stopped moving."

Crow: Much like this story.
Mike: (as Worf) Request permission to shoot them a few more times just to
        make sure.

>        "Admiral Picard to the bridge," Commander Riker said, tapping
>his communicator.  Admiral Jean-Luc Picard entered the bridge from his

Crow: (as Picard) Commander, was that a bald joke?

>        "How much time do we need to get the necessary sensor scans?"
>Picard asked.
>        "No more that ten minutes," Data replied from Ops.

Tom: Three weeks at the outside.
Mike: Next December, at the latest.
Crow: All that temp labor, you know.
Mike: Yeah... hey!
Crow & Tom: (chuckle)

>        "Commander ready your teams," Picard said.  "Worf prepare yours

Tom: (as Daffy Duck) It's mine!  All mine!  I'm rich!  I'm *fabulously* 
       wealthy!

>        Princesses Marrissa and Clara were pushed into a large room on

Mike: But all the signs read 'Argocay aybay,' so she didn't know what to 
        make of it.

>                                                     but it had recently been

Crow: ... with a brig in the corner, I'm sure.

>gray ribbon, we don't want to mess up the puppets," 

Tom: Yeah!  No messing with the puppets!
Crow: You better leave those puppets *alone*!  (aside)  Servo, why are we
        getting so worked up over this?

>                                                       a familiar romulan voice

Mike: (as gray ribbon) All right, pointy-eared ridge-head.

>                          as the girls stumbled.  He walked over to them.
>"The Trakce make wonderful mercenaries but when you need a gentle hand, or

Tom: (as Romulan) So we come to you, Enterprise, long known as the wuss

>                                                  You probably don't know me."

Mike: (as Romulan) ... and that's why I carry the Romulan Express card.

Crow: (as Marrissa) You series traitor!  Ambassador G'Kar, my prepubescent

Mike: Easy there, Crow.
Tom: Yeah, it's just a show!  You should really just relax!

        Ratliff spelled that right this time, too.  I'm impressed.

>                   I assume you are Lieutenant Marrissa Picard, the heir to

>Clara Sutter."

Tom: He's not so much an alien as he is a pointy-eared Boris Badenov.
Mike: No, that was that *other* Ratliff story.
Tom: Oh yeah. (Tom shivers)

>        "Correct, now as part of my duty as a Lieutenant in Starfleet, I
>must ask you why you are violating treaties between our two governments by

Crow: (as Tomalak) The usual.  Setting ourselves up to be humiliated by you.
        You?

>        "We are here at the request of the new head of state of Essex,
>King Martin the First," Tomallok replied.

Tom: A King Martin Production.

>        "I'm sorry but the head of state isn't a King Martin," Marrissa
>replied. "It's Queen Victoria the First, granddaughter of King George the

Mike: (as Marrissa) She can be located in suite 101 at 613 George Street,
        in New Brunswick.  But don't use any of this information for evil.
Crow: You know, you would think that Essex would recognize *England's* 
        Queen Victoria as the first.

>                                                  Martin is fifth in line."

Tom: (as Clara) So you've got no logical choice but to kill us both right
        now.

>        "What if I dispose of you," Tomallok asked Marrissa.

Mike: Tom, Crow and I contribute to your favorite charity!  We have money!

>        "Then Clara's father becomes King Daniel," Marrissa replied.

Crow: Right now, he's only Jack Daniel.

>"But I don't think you want that to happen."
>        "Why is that?"

Tom: (as Marrissa) If an engineer is king, then society becomes "Dilbert"!

>        "Because if it does, you won't make it back to Romulus at the
>next prisoner exchange," Marrissa said.  "Admiral Picard will tear you 
>apart the most painful way he can find."

Mike: (as Picard) Damn you, Tomalak!  I needed that engineer!
Tom: Personal vengeance always takes priority over interstellar diplomacy.
Crow: (as Marrissa) He'll make you read a Ratliff/Gonterman crossover.

>        "What makes you think I'm going to get captured?" Tomallok
>asked.  
>        "Perhaps the dozen Starfleet Security Officers who are now

Tom: So, the Romulans don't have deflector shields?
Mike: It's that, or they just forgot about them.

>"Time to duck Clara."  Marrissa and Clara hit the floor.

Crow: ... and Crow T. Robot hit the wall.  When does this fanfic *end*?
Mike: Hang in there, buddy....

>        Meanwhile about 10 miles up, Data declared, "the Independence is

Mike: (as Data) They have entered the Yavin system.  I think they have
        escaped this fanfic entirely.

>        Admiral Picard opened a hailing frequecy to the Independence,
>"Enterprise to Independence, glad you join us for awhile."
>        Jay Gordon appeared on the screen from his holographic bridge.
>"Admiral, I'm afraid I have bad news,"  

Tom: (as Jay) Our lemonade stand was bought out by an international
        conglomerate and half the kindergarten was downsized.

>                                        he said.  "Not only does the

Mike: For Independence, they certainly are ineffectual on their own.

Tom: So Troi's orders are just optional.

>"Romulan warbird decloaking."

Crow: (as Data) They are in the Yavin system too.
Tom: (as Picard) Damn!  Data, you have to find a way for *us* to get out of
        this fanfic!

>        "Red Alert," Admiral Picard ordered.  "Jay, get ready for battle
>but do not fire until either of us are fired upon. Enterprise out.  Hail

Mike: (as Picard) By the way, somebody tell Starfleet so they can smack
        around the border patrol for screwing up again.

>        "No response," was Ensign Szustakowski's response.  "They are

Crow: (as Szustakowski) They are shooting Gatorade at us, this is not a 
        drill.  Repeat, this is not a drill.

Tom: (as dumb Jay) Should I fire yet?

Mike: WHAT?  Picard's using Marrissa's nomenclature for maneuvers now?
        Has he completely lost grasp of reality!?  You're an Admiral!
        YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN MANEUVERS!
Tom: (as dumb Jay) Should I fire now?

Tom: (as dumb Jay) How about now?  I... Oh!  Wait...

>        "Romulan shields are at 81 percent," 

Crow: (as Data) They are replacing their seltzer.

Tom: About time!  Sheesh, was Jay waiting for permission from Marrissa or
        something?
Mike: Let's see, in "A Royal Wedding", we saw five Federation ships
        take out twelve Warbirds, and similar odds back in "A Battle
        For Bajor" and "Cadet Cruise", so we're supposed to be
        worried when the Romulans are actually outnumbered for a change?

All: D'oh!

Mike: Marrissa is displeased!  Run for your lives!
Crow: You know, if Stephen wrote a book about the Battle of Gettysburg, we 
        would never learn any combat took place.

Mike: The Trakce ship was being chased by a giant rat.  The rat was being
        chased by a cat.  The cat was being chased by a dog.  The dog was
        being chased by the dog catcher.  The dog catcher was being chased

Crow: (singing) I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning...

>                          It was regular circular fire fight above Essex.

Tom: (as Snagglepuss) It was round, even!
Mike: (pulling out a book) Let me know when the pulse-pounding action part 
       is over, you guys.

Crow: (racetrack announcer) And it's the Independence in the lead (Mike:
        Zoom!) followed by the Romulans (Mike: Zoom!), with the Enterprise
        in third (Mike: Zoom!) and the Trakce bringing up the rear. (Mike:
        Sputter, sputter!  Kaff!)

Crow: Well, it wasn't always that way....
Mike: No Catholic bashing, Crow.

Mike: (as Data) All right, sir.  Locking weapons on the Trinity.

Tom: You heard him, Marrissa!  Join him!

>surrendered.  Then noticing Commander Riker she continued.  "Commander,

>he is here."

Crow: If you listen carefully, you can hear a "Whassup!" from underneath
        the floorboards.
Mike: And that takes care of our required "Martin Sussex/Martin Lawrence" 
        joke.

>        "Worf has orders to look for him as soon as all the Trakce and
>Romulans are rounded up," Commander Riker said.  

Tom: (as Riker) We'll have to head them off at the pass.

>                                 "I had better check in.  
>Riker to Enterprise."
>        "This is the Enterprise, I'm sorry I can't talk much right now,
>Number One.  I'm in the middle of a battle."

Mike: (as Picard) But if you'll leave your name and number, we can have
        one of our representatives call you at an inconvenient time and
        harangue you for telephone services.

>        "Just calling you to inform you that your daughter and Clara are
>back in safe hands." 

Crow: (as Riker) We're administering strawberry juice as a precautionary
        measure.

>        "Thank you, Commander, Enterprise out."
>        "Just my luck, I undertake a mission and the Enterprise is

Tom: Well, that depends on whether or not Jay is a gentleman, doesn't it?

>
>        Up in space, the Trinity had just opened fire on thr Trakce

Mike: We appear to have wandered into The Song of Roland, gentlemen; if
        you'll fasten your seat belts we can get back to our story as soon
        as possible.

Crow: He's using Holy Phaser!

Tom: Because a century of Romulan engineers couldn't think of a bigger way 
        to screw up the middle of battle.
Mike: They are going to be sending a *stern* note to Romulan tech support 
        in the morning.

>        "Hail the Romulan, Ensign," Admiral Picard ordered Katherine

>        The Romulan commander had just two words for the Admiral.

Crow: "Bite" and "me".

>                                                                   "We

Tom: Figures...

>        "Mister Data, take a crew over there.  You will submit to
>Commander Data's command and disarm immediately.  Enterprise out."

Mike: (as Picard) We're going to fall for this trap, but not the one after
        that.

>        "Hail the Trinity."

All: HAIL TRINITY!
Crow: For those about to riff, we salute you!

>        "Pope Gregory the Twentieth is responding," Ensign Katherine
>Szustakowski replied.

Tom: He just resolved an investiture controversy with King Henry the
        Seventeenth.
Mike: You know, I think I'm going to put a block on the History Channel's
        web site.

>        "On Screen," the Admiral responded.  Pope Gregory the Twentieth
>looked very out of place sitting in the Command Chair of the Bridge of the
>Trinity,

Crow: Actually, it's just the new Pope-Mobile.

>         but no less than the rest of his crew.  

Tom: Whom Stephen will now take about three years to introduce to us all.

>                                                 It was kind of funny to
>see a bridge like the one on the original Enterprise manned by monks and 
>nuns and commanded by his holiness, Pope Gregory the Twentieth.  

Mike: Funny?  No.  Surreal and goofy?  Yes.
Crow: And the fact that they had all taken vows of silence made it really
        hard to get a status report out of them.

>                                                                On second

>        "God is always willing to lead a helping hand if you need him,"

Tom: ... and, more importantly, so is Ratliff.

>        "What are you doing in the neighborhood?" the Admiral asked.
>"This is rather far from the Vatican."
>        "I was visiting the Arch-Diocese of Garson's sector when I heard
>my services as a Religious Leader might be of service on my homeworld,"

Mike: (as Gregory) Some idiot keeps calling Garson and asking if they can
        order now.

>                                                                        the

Crow: (as Gregory) Since all of those silly countries rejected monarchy 
        and all.  But, I'll help restore the concept of "Divine Right of 
        Kings!"  Yes, I will!

>                                                               I'd like to 
>end that drought." 

Tom: Actually, this is a good move on Gregory's part.  He's asserting that
        at least God has control over Marrissa.

>        "Well I'll see that Queen Victoria contacts you to set up the
>details.  Thanks again for the help,"  Picard said.
>        "Don't thank me, thank the Lord, our God," the Pope responded.
>        "I will, Enterprise out."

Mike: (as Picard) Well, I would if Roddenberry didn't demand we all see
        religion as primitive, silly and pointless.

>        "Incoming hail from the Independence," Szustakowski said.

Crow: (as Picard) Stand by to call the insurance company with a claim. 

>        "On Screen," Picard said, yet another time.
>        "Admiral, I have a problem," Jay Gordon said.
>        "And what would that be?" Picard asked.

Tom: (as Jay) I got a Social Studies test the same day as my English 
        paper's due.
Mike: (as Jay) I've got this growing in weird places...
Crow: (as Jay) I'm into my bookie for 30 large.  You gotta help me!

>        "The upper level officers on this ship were placed in the brig
>by the Trakce and Romulans who took over the Independence,"  Jay said.  
>"Since they couldn't use the computer, they powered the forcefields from 
>life support circuits and they welded the doors shut though most of
>the ship so we can't even get to some of the trapped officers."

Tom: So, now that they've had the force fields on for three days, all the 
        senior officers have had a good 72 hours without oxygen and now
        they're spending a lot more time staring at the wallpaper and
        giggling mysteriously than they used to.

>        "I'll send Commander LaForge over to solve your problem.

Mike: Yes.  Just him.

>Enterprise out."  Captain Picard then began walk over toward the forward
>turbolift saying, "If anyone else calls me, tell them that I'm unavailable.

Crow: (as Picard) If anyone wants to see me in person, tell them I'm French.

>Counselor, you have the bridge."

Tom: (as Picard) Try not to sell it to gullible tourists this time.

>
>        It was his cousins Clara and Marrissa who finally found Martin.
>The ten year old boy had taken the confusion which the Enterprises rescue 
>of his cousins had caused to escape into the forest.  

Mike: So, finally, a Ratliff extra makes a choice rationally motivated by 
        self-preservation.
Crow: Namely, choosing to be ten years old in a Ratliff story.

>                                                      Marrissa and Clara 
>wouldn't have found him either if it weren't for one thing that Clara had
>never done.

Tom: Please!  We lived through "The Only Constant"'s end scene *and* "All
        the King's Horses"' pool scene!  Weren't those bad enough?

>        "You know Marrissa, it's kind of strange," Clara said.
>        "What's strange?"  Marrissa asked

Mike: (as Clara) That Heckle and Jeckle cartoon where they realize they're
        cartoon characters and can turn into a mouse or a traffic light or
        anything if they just decide to, and they go around living the high
        animated life for the rest of the short.

>        "Here we are in a large forest, and I have never climbed a real
>tree," Clara replied.

Crow: (as Clara) I have a sudden urge for an amazing coincidental plot 
        point.

>        "Then we better rectify the matter,"

Tom: *Hey!*  Oh, wait.  I see....

>                                             Marrissa said.  "That tree
>over there looks like a good climbing tree.

Mike: Sure!  Why not?  It's not as if they're supposed to be looking for 
        a child who might be dying or anything.  What better time could
        there be to climb a tree?  Hey!  The next time the Enterprise
        gets into a fight, why not take the opportunity to do some warp
        donuts?  Hmmm?

>        They began climbing up the stately oak tree, 

Crow: Oh no, they're going to run into Bruce Wayne's secret treehouse!

Mike: (as Marrissa, singing) Look at we, we're as helpless as a Kid's Crew
        up a tree...
Bots: (groans)

>"I think someone has climbed this tree before."

Tom: (as Marrissa) You can tell by his pheromone trail.

>        A voice came down from above, "Yes some one has and if you are
>Romulans, I'd suggest you climb back down and start running."

Mike: Stephen, you're in danger of violating your "wrath of God in the
        fanfic" quota!
Crow: Where's the wrath of God *for* the fanfic?

>        Clara and Marrissa looked at each other and said in unison,
>"Martin."

Tom: Or one of those Japanese soldiers from World War II who hasn't 
        heard it's over.

>        "You have five seconds," Martin replied.

Crow: (as Michael Palin) Three seconds, sir.

>        "Matin Sussex, we are not Romulan's," Marrissa shouted up the

Mike: Look at that, she treed a bit player.

>	 "I'm Marrissa Picard of the Starship Enterprise and my friend here

Crow: The dramatic return of the U.S.S. Same!
All: (lamely cheer)

>        "If you are Marrissa Picard of the Starship Enterprise then what
>did you carve and were did you carve it on STARDATE 47577," Martin asked.

Mike: (as Marrissa) MAFP + JG 4-ever?
Tom: No, Mike.  You're confusing Marrissa with a normal teenage girl.
Mike: Ah...

Crow: (as Marrissa) Blue!  No, green!  AAAAAUUUUGGHH!

>        "Strawberry juice," Marrissa replied.

Mike: (as Martin) Who did you most recently subjugate and bend to your will?
Tom: (as Marrissa) Jay!

>        "I'm coming down," Martin said.  

Tom: Martin seems to know as much about Marrissa as we do.
Crow: He must have read these fanfics too.
Mike: Poor kid.

>                                           A blond boy descended.  He was
>shirtless, and was carrying his shirt like a bag, 

Tom: And wearing his sneakers on his forehead.  He wasn't exactly a nuclear 
        scientist, here.

Mike: His pants were full of pine cones.

>        "So you are the famous young Lieutenant," Martin said.  "You
>have no idea how long I have wanted to meet you."

Crow: So how did he know anything about her that wasn't in the public record
        and therefore something any Romulan could in principle know?

>        "I can make a good guess, cousin," Marrissa said.  "My guess is
>about a year."
>        "Cousin?" Martin asked.

Crow: (as Martin) Is it too late to convert to Mormonism?
Mike: Crow, you seem a bit harsh on religion this time out.
Crow: I'm still bitter over "Exposing the Darkness at Point Loma Nazarene
        College".
Mike: Ah.
Tom: Enough plugs!  This is the most self indulgent MiSTing ever!
Mike: If it was, we'd have plugged "Sailor Babylon" too. 
Tom: Just stop!

>        "We were doing some research to determine who the heirs to this

Crow: (as Marrissa) ... and I'm my own grandpa.

>        "Wow, I'm related to the famous youngest Lieutenant in
>Starfleet," Martin said.
>        "What no comment as to being royalty?" Clara asked.

Tom: (as Clara) Fool!  Comment on her royalty now, or be destroyed!

>        "That Romulan told me that, I wasn't impressed," Martin said.
>"Then I began to analyze his motives and he grew most annoyed.  How have 
>you taken the recent turn of events."
>        "Martin, you should become a Ship's Counselor," Marrissa said.

All: NOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Mike: It's spreading!  The cancer that is the Kid's Crew is spreading!

>"Tell me, have you ever considered going to Starfleet Academy?"

Crow: (as Marrissa) Or, better yet, use an Encyclopedia Brown scheme to
        subvert and avoid a time-tested mechanism to protect both children
        and the integrity of the fleet?

>        "What kid hasn't after hearing about your exploits?" Martin
>said.

Tom: There's that Nicholas Seafort kid.
Mike: Oh, and that Miles Vorkosigan.

>        "Marrissa we better report in," Clara said.  "We don't want our
>parents to start worring."

Crow: That'd be an interesting "Celebrity Deathmatch".

>        "Agreed," Marrissa said.  "Martin, would you care to join us?"

Tom: (as Marrissa) You'll have to stand on a table in Ten-Forward, pull 
        down your pants and sing "John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt" if you 
        do, though.

>        "Would I ever," Martin said.
>        "Lieutenant Marrissa Picard to the Enterprise," Marrissa said
>after tapping her communicator.  "Three to beam up."

Mike: And another child finds himself assimilated by the Marrissa

[SOL]

[Tom stands alone on the bridge, wearing a blonde wig.]

Tom: Hi there!  Do you know me?  Of course you do!  I'm the 
     saviour of the galaxy, Marrissa Amber Flores Picard!
     Crown Princess of Essex, head of all the Kid's Crews
     in Starfleet, and bringer of a fantastic deal for *you*!  
     You see, I've been in many tough scrapes, and I've come 
     through them all with flying colors!  How?  Well, some
     might say it's because of nepotism.  Others claim it's
     because I use underlings as cannon fodder.  And the more 
     fanciful among us claim it's because my, heh, "author" 
     writes me out of bad situations.  But no.  My ability to 
     survive formidable odds comes from my training, training 
     that I'll share with *you* in my new Marrissa Amber Flores 
     Picard Survival Course!

[Various "oohs!" and "ahs!" can be heard.]

Tom: That's right, just by taking my course, you too will be
     able to face down enemy war fleets, dispatch enemies with 
     primitive, hastily made weapons, hash out complicated treaties 
     between warring nations, or even avoid photographers who want 
     to take pictures of you when you're at the pool.  Just a few
     easy lessons, and you'll be able to handle all of these crises 
     and many, many more!  Any questions?  Yes sir?

[The camera shifts to Mike, who's wearing an earring and has wrinkles 
 on his nose.]

Mike: Hi.  Can your course lead me to spiritual enlightenment?

[Back to Tom.]

Tom: Sure thing!  In fact, let's hear from one of our graduates!

[A taped image is shown.  A bald black man with a beard sits behind 
 a desk.]

Sisko: Hello.  Before taking Marrissa's course, I was a 
       lowly junior officer pining over the death of my wife. 
       But now, I'm in command of a space station, I've got a 
       great-looking girlfriend, and I'm the Emissary of the 
       Prophets!  Thanks, Marrissa!

[Back to the audience.  Gypsy, who's dressed like a Klingon, stands.]

Gypsy: Will your course allow me to bring glory to the Empire?

[Back to Tom.]

Tom: Of course!  Our graduates are trained to always act 
     honorably!  And they're also taught how to eliminate
     witnesses to dishonorable acts, just in case.

[Back to the audience.  A tall, red-haired man dressed in a tuxedo 
 stands with a wide grin on his face.]

Conan: Lance, I was a homely talk show host until I took your
       course, but now...

[The view returns to Tom.]

Tom: Sir?  Sir!  You're looking for the "How To Be A Handsome 
     Man" course.  That's down the hall.

[The audience.]

Conan: Thanks!  Oh, and by the way, you're a very handsome woman!

[Tom again.]

Tom: Thank you!  Okay, time for one more question.  You sir!

[The audience.  Crow is dressed like a Cardassian.  You figure 
 out how.]

Crow: Marrissa, I'm a Gul.  Can your course help me defeat my 
      foes in the Federation?

[Back to Tom.  He chuckles.]

Tom: I'm afraid not.  In fact, just for asking that question, we're 
     going to have to carve "I was beaten by a bunch of kids" into 
     your hide.  Sorry! 

[The commercial sign light begins to flash.]

Tom: Well, that's all the time we have!  Remember to sign up 
     for the Marrissa Amber Flores Picard Survival Course!
     Since the Federation has no money, it's free!  Remember!
     The Marrissa Amber Flores Picard Survival Course!  It'll
     change your life!

[Tom hits the commercial sign light.]

[Commercials: Valtrex: It's about supressing nausea while watching this
 commercial.]

[Theater]

[Mike and the bots enter and sit down.]

Crow: I wonder if Honor Harrington took that course?
Mike: Hush.

        sugar, and I accidentally ejected the core. 
Crow: And?
Mike: (Shamefully) The core hit a planet, blowing it up.

Tom: (as Marrissa) Can't I just go back to wearing my bunny pajamas?

Mike: Stop getting promoted every two seconds!

Crow: Ratliff's writing hot Treksmut now!

>        "You aren't the one in this uncomfortable garment," Marrissa

Tom: Of course, Troi *did* spend seven years wearing "uniforms" that Yeoman 
        Rand would have refused.

>          "Remind me not to become heir to any more planets."

Mike: Sorry, it's Ratliff.  Your universal domination is assured.

>        "It can't be that bad," Doctor Picard responded.
>        "Well at least I now have a level 14 clearance," Marrissa said.
>        "Fourteen," Doctor Picard said.  "That's one below the Fleet
>Admiral and two above what your father has."

Crow: (as Beverly) Oh, and you can fly, you can heal the sick, and you have
        a million billion kazillion hit points. 

>        "I guess there are some good reasons to be next in line to the
>throne," Marrissa said.  

Tom: Sure, she's potentially lost her ability to choose her own life, but 
        on the other hand, she can get info on all of her commanding 
        officer's traffic tickets.

>        "How did you know I am pregnant?" the Doctor asked.

Mike: After about seven months or so, it's kind of hard to hide.

>        "You know that tricorder that seems to be permanently attached
>to my hand," Marrissa responded.  

Crow: (as Marrissa) You know!  The one this story's never mentioned before?

>                                  "It was a medical tricorder when you 
>arrived back on the Enterprise."

Tom: (as Marrissa) Before that, it was an Engineering PADD, then before
        that, it was a Type III Phaser Rifle.
Mike: So, basically Marrissa feels nothing wrong with violating her
        adoptive step-mother's civil rights.
Crow: Well, this is Marrissa and an adult we're talking about here, Mike.

>        Suddenly their was a knock on the door, and from the other side
>someone said.  

Tom: "Is this the men's room?"

>                  "Princess Marrissa, your carriage is here."

Mike: (as man) We had a devil of a time getting it up here into orbit, let 
        me tell you.  Oh, I'm afraid that re-entry's going to be a bit rough
        on the horses.

>        Outside the Prime Minister's residence, where Marrissa had been

>to the carriage were four black Arabian stallions.  

Crow: Look out!  You're in rural Indiana!
Tom: That is to say, Indiana.

>carriage in the backward facing seat.

Mike: Marrissa wasn't sure why her natural father's vacuum desiccated 
        corpse was there, but anything for tradition.

>                                       He was wearing his dress uniform
>with all his medals arrayed across his chest.  

Crow: (as Picard) This one's for when I beat Admiral Ramirez at racquetball.
        This one's for extreme valor when I surrendered to that Bolian
        garbage scow.  This one's a reward for getting Ambassador McCloud a 
        danish....

>                                               Marrissa climbed up to join 
>her father sitting across from him.  

Tom: (as Picard) Now remember, Marrissa, this coach turns back into a
        pumpkin at midnight, so don't stay out too late!

>                                      In front of her carriage and a little
>to the right stood Clara and her father's carriage.  Clara apparently had 
>had better luck with her dress.  

Mike: She scratched off the gold stuff and won $50 from the New Jersey
        Lottery.

>                                  She sat facing backwards as her father
>Prince Daniel Sutter sat uncomfortable facing forward.  As Marrissa 
>watched he ran a finger around his dress uniform's collar.

Crow: (as Daniel Sutter) Damned suicide capsule's in here *somewhere*...

>        In front of Clara's carriage sat yet another carriage.  This one

Tom: He keeps acorns in his shirt.  He's not exactly sensitive.

>        At a signal from a man in royal livery standing at the end of
>the Prime Minister's residence, the column of Royals moved out.  

Mike: Oh no, they're moving to Nashville under cover of... daytime!

Tom: So, Worf grades his security officers on how well they can ride
        horses?

>dress uniforms, the yellow and black being in stark contrast to the
>red and gold of the royal uniforms.  

Mike: For "being in stark contrast," read "clashing hideously".

>                                     The last carriage meanwhile contained 
>Queen Victoria the First and her Prime Minister. The Queen looked radiant
>in her purple robes across from the her recently recovered Prime Minister.

Crow: Turns out he'd been lost in the couch cushions all this time. 
Tom: So when do Han Solo and Luke Skywalker walk up to receive their medals?

>The Prime Minister wore his tuxedo with a couple orders which the previous 
>King had given him.

Mike: He's a pretty incompetent Prime Minister if the king has to sew
        orders into his clothes.

>                     As they left the palace grounds the sides of the road
>began to be filled by the cheering people of  Essex.

Crow: (as people) Yay!  Let's accept living vicariously through these 
        inbred nobles as a substitute for achieving success on our own!
Tom: Meanwhile, Canada watches via closed-circuit television.

>V R done in purple on them.  

Mike: V R troopers?
Crow: So the government of Essex is sponsored by Saban?

>                              In the crowd people also waved black flags

Tom: ... and they sprayed at Marrissa with the Black Flag, but she was
        still there.
Crow: No, they're becoming pirates.
Mike: They're plague carriers.

>                                                                        with
>the current insignia of Starfleet on them, showing their appreciation of 
>Starfleet's help in the latest problem.  Marrissa smiled at the crowd.

Tom: (as Marrissa) I love the petty rabble and their adulation.

>        They neared the Cathedral of Saint Pauls.  

Mike: The place to be for baptisms, confirmations, weddings and fish 
        sticks.
Crow: You've tried the rest, now try the best!

>                                                   The first carriage
>stopped and Martin Sussex got out first and assisted a man in royal livery 
>in helping his mother out.

Tom: So, they assisted Martin in assisting his mother.
Mike: Yep.
Tom: What?

>                           The Princess Mary's train was immediately
>picked up by the young girls picked out by the Queen.  The carriage moved
>off and Clara's stopped in front of the Cathedral.  Clara's father, 
>Prince Daniel stepped off and helped his daughter down.  

Crow: They're all going to see Red Hot Riding Hood singing at the club.

>                                                          Clara no longer, 

Tom: ... she was now known as "Timmy".

>she had obviously adjusted to the role well and now the title Princess 
>Clarrissa fit well as a four girls

Mike: (as Rodney Dangerfield) Hey, now, I'm not saying Princess Clarrissa
        is big, but four girls could fit in her title, if ya know what
        I'm saying....

>                                   from the Kid's Crew's engineering
>department stepped forward to pick up Clarrissa's train.  

Crow: Local service for Matawan, South Amboy, Perth Amboy, Woodbridge, 
        Avenel, Rahway, Linden, Elizabeth, North Elizabeth, Newark, 
        Hoboken and New York arriving on the northbound track.
All: (locomotive noises)

>                                                          Then Marrissas 
>carriage pulled up.  Her father, Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, got out and 
>helped Marrissa down.  Four specially chosen young girls from the Enterprise 

Tom: ... were to be the special sacrifice unto the dark goddess Marrissa.

>stepped up to pick up her train.  

Mike: Much to the surprise of the passengers inside the train.

>                                  Into the Cathedral, they proceeded.  

Crow: On into the valley of death, rode the six hundred.

Crow: They're going to open up a used parts shop!

>Queen Victoria, at her Prime Minister's side awaiting the signal for her 
>to enter.  

Tom: Hey, batter batter, swing batter batter.
[Mike stands up, tugs at his ear, turns to the side and pats his belly 
    a few times.]

>           Martin and his mother proceeded to their front row right-side 
>seats as did Clara and her father.  Marrissa took up her position in a 
>seat on the far right of the altar, next to the crown.

Tom: ...and God immediately smote her with lightning for defiling the altar.
        The End.

>                                                        Her father walked
>back to the front row left side where the Command crew of the Enterprise sat.  

Tom: Once again, PULSE-POUNDING HEART-RACING EYE-GOUGING SEATING CHART 
       ACTION!
Crow: Speaking of eye-gouging, Mike...
Mike: No.  Suffer with the rest of us, you wuss.

>As the Pope was not yet ready to start, Marrissa looked around the room. 

Crow: This must be the *ultimate* Franklin Mint commemorative chess set.
Mike: She hoped to stop by the concession stand for special Pope
        merchandise.

>Behind the crew of the Enterprise sat the Command Crew of the Independence.
>Jay Gordon having got the message that he was to have an aisle seat was 
>guarding it jealously.

Crow: So, Jay is jealously guarding the seat that he is sitting on?

>                        Marrissa wondered if he knew what was in store
>for him.

Mike: Any bets that it'll somehow involve strawberries?
Tom: I'll take that action.
Crow: I'm in for twenty.

>        Next her eyes were drawn to the Master of Ceremonies, the only
>member of the Command Crew not in the front row.  

Tom: Bert Parks?
Crow: Billy Crystal?
Mike: Barbara Feldon?
Bots: Huh?

>                                                  Lieutenant Commander Data
>stood on the left side of the altar in red and gold livery.

Tom: Including saddle!

>                                                             As each of the
>guests to the coronation had arrived he had announced them with all their 
>titles and honors.

Mike: Oh no!  Marrissa's programmed Data to recite her titles for her!
Crow: All the goodness in the universe just died.
Tom: Again?

>                    Now once again he spoke, "Her Majesty, Queen Victoria
>of Essex, first of that name.  Defender of the Realm and Head of State, 
>granddaughter of our late king of happy memory, King George the Fourth, 
>escorted by her Majesty's Prime Minister, Sir William Lancaster, the member
>from South Londonderry, member of the order of the Defenders of Essex."

Mike: That's just as bad as the "Mystery Science Theater 3000 Vice-
        Presidential Command Performance Academy of Robot's Choice Awards
        Preview Special"!

>        The Queen of Essex began her procession down the aisle.  She
>began it with some hesitation but as she progressed, she grew more confident.  

Crow: (singing) You can tell by the way she uses her walk she's an Essex
        queen... no time to talk.

>As she reached the altar, she kneeled.  

Tom: She places the football... waits for Charlie Brown to come running
        up...

>                                        As she got back up, Pope Gregory the 
>Twentieth began speaking.  "Victoria of Essex, you come here today to be

>and definitely not one to be taken lightly.  Before you mount the throne,

Crow: Please, Mike?  Ratliff's just handing them to us now.
Mike: No.

>must ask you, are you willing to take on the responsibility?  

Tom: (as Pope) Will you pose for the "heads" side of our coinage, if Star
        Trek has money this month?

>                                                              To be the
>example for all your people, those alive now and those who will be born in 
>your reign.  

Mike: (as Pope) To have and to hold, until assassination do you part?

>             To defend your people to your last breath.  To grant mercy to
>those accused and justice to those oppressed.  

Crow: (as Pope) To allow those who go bankrupt in Monopoly the chance to
        'reorganize' their debts and continue play.
Tom: (as Pope) To allow those who purchase several of the same item to count
        them as one item in the Express lane.
Mike: (as Pope) To demand airlines allow us two pieces of carry-on luggage
        on every flight.

>                                               To govern firmly during 
>your life and to uphold the rights of your people."

Crow: (as Pope) To live as long as possible and spew out a few kids and
        thus prevent Marrissa from accruing even *more* titles.
Tom: (as Pope) To punctuate willy-nilly with little regard to the rules.
Mike: (as Pope) Do you promise to use them as you will?  And do you promise
        not to throw them into space... until such time as you grow
        *weary* of them?

>        "I am willing," Victoria responded.

Crow: (as Victoria) If it doesn't interfere with catching "The Simpsons."

>        "To those gathered within these walls and those without," the
>Pope continued.  "Are you willing to live under the rule of this woman as 
>your Queen.  

Tom: (as Pope) Can you put off your dreams of becoming a *real* democracy
        just a little longer?

>             To have her guard your rights and serve you.  To in times of 
>trouble make decisions for you when time is of the essence.  Do you
>want her as your Queen?"

Mike: (as audience member) Are you saying we have a choice?

>        "We do," came the overwhelming response of the assembled crowd
>both within Saint Paul's and without.  

Crow: (droopy voice) Nay.
Tom: Oh, how nice that the peasants get a choice in determining their 
        monarch.  JOIN THE 18TH CENTURY PEOPLE!  IT'S CALLED REPRESENTATIVE
        GOVERNMENT!  LOOK INTO IT, PEOPLE!
Mike: Actually, they do have a Parliament.  Ratliff blew it up in the
        first part.
Crow: I think that the public's just picking someone for the press to 
        gossip about for a few years.

>        "Then take your rightful place by both hereditary and the approval of
>the people,"  the Pope said.  "Would the heir to the throne step forward."

Tom: Uh-uh-uh!  Didn't say "Simon Says!"  You lose, the monarchy is 
        dissolved.

>        Marrissa moved over to take Victoria's place before the Pope as

Crow: (as Pope) Would you rather shoot her now or wait 'till you get home?

>that she is unable to?  Are you also ready to support her in ways which she
>will need in the long reign ahead of her?  To act as heir to the throne until

Tom: (as Pope) Now, as runner up, you will receive these lovely parting
        gifts.

>        "I am," Marrissa replied with a sight tremble.
>        "Then bring the crown so we may crown your Queen," the Pope
>ordered.

Mike: Better yet, bring a baseball bat so we can crown Marrissa with it.
Crow: You know, I get the feeling the Pope is involved in this story, in 
        some way.
Tom: I had that feeling too, but I'm not sure.  Maybe we could mention 
        the Pope about 7000 more times to be sure?

>           The Pope retreated to the throne

All: *Run away!  Run away!*

>                                            which Victoria vacated to kneel
>before the altar. Marrissa retrieved the Crown and it's accompanying articles

Crow: (as Marrissa) Uh... I kinda broke this, but I used some Krazy Glue 
        and some Bead Magic parts and I guess it looks almost as good... 
        doesn't it?

>                          He picked up the crown and raised it above 
>Victorias head.  (Making sure it was oriented the right way)

Tom: (as Pope) Pointy side up, and...
Mike: Oh, *thank* you for that utterly vital detail, Steve. 

>                                                              "I crown thee,
>Queen Victoria the First of Essex, Defender of Faith and Head of State."  

Crow: King of Suede.
Tom: Marquis of Queensbury.
Mike: Duke of Earl.

>Lowering the crown onto her head he said.  "God Save the Queen."
>        The assembled crowd then responded with "God Save the Queen."

Mike: Then the Sex Pistols chimed in with their version of "God Save The
        Queen".

>        Next he picked up an scepter from the cushion Marrissa bore.
>"Carry this Scepter to remember the weight of your rule."

Crow: (as Gregory) ... and as a token of your robbing the Prime Minister of
        his manhood.

>        Barely audible from were Marrissa stood, the Queen muttered, "As if
>the crown weren't heavy enough."

Tom: Yeah, cry us a river, *your majesty*.  The folks who don't have their
        every whim catered to feel real sorry for you.

>        As this ended the crowning portion of the coronation, Data

Crow: Topping that list is... there's not much more of this fanfic left
       to read!

Mike: Victoria doesn't have a sense of humor!  There.  I said it, and I'd 
        say it again if I had to.

Crow: Uh... sir, could you remove your hat?  The people behind you want 
        to see.

[Crow clears his throat loudly, but doesn't comment.]
Tom: (oblivious)  And beheaded Marrissa.  The End.

Mike: And now the Flores is back.

Tom: (as Daniel, defiantly) NO!
Crow: Just checking... does Data have *any* connection, formal or informal,

Mike: He knows Marrissa.

>        "Since we have a large number of titles floating around,"

Tom: (as Victoria) We're practically giving them away!

>Victoria stated.  "We hereby grant you the title of Duke of Yorkshire, a

Crow: (as Lone Star) How about that?!  I'm a *duke*!

>        "Princess Clarrissa Ann, Approach the throne."

Tom: (as a mother) Princess Clarrissa Ann!  You approach the throne *this
        very minute*!!

>        "Clarrissa, your talents as an Engineer have not escaped us,"
>Victoria said.  "Neither has your suggestions as to an excellent economic 
>prospect.   For both these reasons I hereby grant you the title of Marquise

Mike: (as Clarrissa) Oh no!  I'm in charge of Wesley!  Oh wait, she said 
        Wessex.

>        "Princess Mary Sussex, approach the throne."

Crow: (as Clarrissa) So, should I sit down then, or...?

Tom: Ten percent off this weekend only at Menard's!

>        and it has occurred to me that such a title would be helpful in your 
>occupation.  Therefore we grant you the title Duchess of Greenwich."

Mike: How exactly will this title help a *bartender*?
Crow: (as queen) Now, do you want to keep that title or trade it in for 
        $200 and what's behind door number three?

>        "Martin Sussex, approach the throne."
>        "As your mother has received the Duchy of Greenwich, we are
>granting you the traditional Earlship of the heir to that Dukedom, Rise

Tom: I called Earl Flores once for one of those FTD Pick-Me-Up bouquets.
        They were very reasonable.
Mike: Flores, Tom.  Not Florist.
Tom: Oh.
Crow: (as Victoria) Arise, Sir Loin of Beef... Sir Osis of Liver... Sir
        Cumference of the Circle...

>Data intoned a sign of a smile darting across his face.
>        Marrissa's father approached the throne glancing at Marrissa
>briefly, the message, 'If you arranged this ...' clear.

Crow: If you arranged this, you'd be done by now.
Tom: Mike, does it hurt any less if we just accept and don't question?
Mike: I don't know, Tom!  I just don't know!

Mike: So, really, this is just a Ratliff Introduction Scene, with trumpets?
Crow: I guess so...

Crow: (as Jay) Made it!  All right now, you observed something?

>        This went on for a couple hours,

Tom: Only a couple?  It seems like we've had to read about it for much 
        longer than that.

Crow: Oops.  Sorry.

Crow: He'll think it's Commander Troi's quarters.
Tom: Just strew chocolate all over the place and you're there.
Mike: Um, you could have simply redecorated the holodeck.  It would have
        taken, what, sixty seconds?  Tops?

>        "I agree, especially with that oak dance floor and the star

Crow: If they haven't caught on to Marrissa's ability to accrue never
        ending glory by now, that embryo will be on the Kid's Crew
        before Beverly tells Jean Luc.
Tom: So, you're saying she'll tell him sometime in the second trimester.

>Deanna said.  "Marrissa and her friends never stop surprising people.  Half
>my caseload of late it because they thought of something before some officer."

Mike: The other half of Deanna's caseload caused her to get that "aphasia"
        disease from the first season of DS9.
Crow & Tom: Fanboy!

All: Yet.

>        "There is that," Deanna said.  "Here comes Data with those

Tom: Unless they're talking about paintings, that makes no sense whatsoever.
Mike: There's a Slartibartfast joke in there somewhere, but I'm not 
        making it.

>        Meanwhile Marrissa was trying to get a date for the ball.
>"Computer, open a private channel to Ensign Jay Gordon aboard the USS 
>Independence."

Mike: (as Marrissa) Be sure to dial 10-10-321 first.
Crow: No, Mike.  By this time, it's 10-10-10-10-10-321.

>        "One moment please," the Computer replied.  Marrissa waited.

Tom: The embarassing thing about these com channels is they're party lines. 
        Marrissa has to wait for Farmer Dave to finish up talking with his 
        vet about cattle stifles before she can get on with the story.

>        "Jay Gordon, starship Independence, nice to see you again,
>Princess," Jay said.

Tom: Why does Jay feel compelled to introduce himself to Marrissa?
Mike: Maybe he's just pretending these stories never happened.
Crow: Wish I could...

>        "Drop the title, Jay," Marrissa replied.  

Tom: Yeah, we all know how she hates fame and titles and stuff.

>                                                  "I was wondering if

Voice: Let me get this straight... even Wonder Weenie there can get a date?
Tom: ... the heck?
Mike: Bitter editor.
Tom: Ah.

>        "OK on two conditions," Jay replied.  "One, your cousin doesn't

Mike: AGH!  Why must you make these disgusting mental pictures appear in
        my mind, Ratliff?

>        "That I can guarantee," Marrissa said.  "I've found a much
>better dress that doesn't go near touching the floor."

Tom: Oh, the humanity!  Have you at long last, Ratliff, no decency?

>        "Then I will meet you at 1900 hours at your quarters, I assume

Mike: She's only thirteen.  She can't move out on her own.

Tom: (as Clara) Considering it makes you look like you're wearing Lego
        blocks.

>almost enough for me to start cursing Marrissa for getting me the job."
>        "You know the only thing that is keeping Marrissa from cursing

Mike: (as Clara) The Royal Harem.  She's been in there with them
       for *hours* now.

>        "What?" Alexander asked sharply.
>        "She now has a level fourteen clearance,"  

Crow: ... which enables her to review her Permanent Record.

>                                                   Clara replied.  "Boy,

Tom: (as Alexander) "Accidentally"?  Is *that* what he told you?
 
>        "Don't worry give me a half an hour in this out fit and I'll be

>        Meanwhile Marrissa had just gotten her pink ruffled dress on
>when the door chimed.  Beverly answered it and said, "Marrissa, your date is

Mike: It's the 14th of April, 1910.  Is that a problem?
Tom: Oh, that was the day William Howard Taft threw out the first pitch in 
        the Philadelphia Athletics - Washington Senators game, starting the 
        tradition of the President throwing out the first baseball of the 
        season.
Mike: Tom.
Tom: The Senators won 3-0.
Mike: Tom.
Tom: And 31 years later on April 14, Pete Rose was born.
Mike: Tom.
Tom: And on April 14th, 1967, Herman's Hermits went gold with the single 
        "There's A Kind of Hush."
Mike: Tom.
Tom: I'll behave.
Mike: Thank you.

>        As Jay entered in his dress uniform, his face was blushing.
>"You show excellent taste, Marrissa." her father said.

Crow: (as Picard) He's positively *scrumptious*!

>        "In dates or dress," Marrissa asked causing Jay to blush again.
>        "Both actually,"  Jean-Luc said.  "I was worried that you'd
>leave yourself open for the evening."

Mike: (as Picard) But, thankfully, you remembered to button up in front.

>        "I'd never get to dance then," Marrissa replied.  "No one my age
>in Starfleet is allowed to fraternize with me because they're all at least 
>two ranks below me.   And most others wouldn't dare dance with the heir to 
>the throne.  

Tom: (as Marrissa) There's not even a shallow twit who'd do anything for a
        chance at political advancement anywhere on the planet.

>             So I chose my own partner, who I couldn't find a reason for 
>anyone to object or put two and two together to get scandal."

Mike: Two and two makes scandal?
Crow: Yeah, that was some of Andrew Wiles's earlier work.

>        "You take good care of my daughter," Jean Luc Picard told Jay.
>        "I will," Jay replied.
>        "Oh and Ensign," the Admiral added.  

Tom: (as Picard) Is your refrigerator running?

>                                             "Don't let anyone cut in."
>        As Marrissa and Jay left the room, Beverly spoke up,  "Jean-Luc
>there is something I've been meaning to tell you and now seems like as good
>a time as ever."
>        "What is Beverly?"

Mike: (as Alex Trebek) Ooh, I'm sorry.  How much did you wager?

>        "I'm pregnant," she replied
>        Jean-Luc Picard was speechless for a moment then he replied,

Crow: (as Picard) It's not mine!

>"That is wonderful news.  

Tom: (as Picard) My little sperms are still swimming!  Woo hoo!

>                           I'm finally going to be a father for real.  

Crow: Better not let Marrissa hear you say that...
Mike: (monotone) It makes me feel better than Cats.  I want to feel it 
        again and again.

>                                                                      If it
>wasn't for the fact that we have to attend a ball, I'd be tempted to take 
>you out somewhere special to celebrate."
>        "You can do that tomorrow," Beverly replied.  "Alyssa has found
>a four star restaurant on the planet, that she thinks we would enjoy."

Crow: Alyssa... who?
Mike: Oh, that's Alyssa Ogawa.  Her uncommon card in the premier edition 
        is a Biology Mission Specialist, and her rare First Contact card...
Tom: Mike, no ST:CCG in the theater!

>        "OK, tomorrow we will dine out and I'll leave Marrissa in

>        "Why Marrissa?"

Crow: Ratliff.  Complex.  Enough said.

>        "Do you actually think that any other person other than Data
>won't have a hang over tomorrow?"

Tom: Yes, booze helps all ambitious young Starfleet officers gain command.
        This message brought to you by the booze council. 
Mike: But synthehol doesn't leave you with a hangover!
Crow: See, it's funny because it's... (falters) teenage alcoholism...

Crow: He takes her hand... starts running downfield... he's at the 30, he's

        runs off the field, into the stands, and attacks the pretzel guy!

Mike: (as Beverly) And the other voices in my head feel the same way too.

Mike: Oh, for that Hawaiian Punch freaky guy to come out and torment them...

Tom: I presume that the ceremony will be held in Hawaii?

Crow: (as Morris) I'm talking about the beatnik poet who cruises the bars
        down the Jersey shore, around Asbury Park and Deal.  Which Jean-Luc
        Picard are you thinking of?

>        "Hey, it's not every day that he learns that he is going to

Tom: Of course, since his last couple shore leaves have involved him
        getting kidnapped by Q, stuck on some weird treasure hunt with that 
        crazy archeology lady, chased through his ship by terrorists trying 
        to steal magic space particles, and generally getting beaten up 
        like an intragalactic punching bag, I'd forgive him if he decided
        his 9-to-5 job was a wee bit more pleasant.

Mike: Apparently Stephen is storing his punctuation marks up for the winter.
Crow: I can just see him with squirrel-cheeks full of semicolons now.

>        "Just don't enjoy diplomacy too much,"  Marrissa replied.  

Tom: Once again, Marrissa logic rears its ugly head... diplomacy is a 
        recreational activity, and command is to be enjoyed.

Crow: (as Marrissa) Or should I say, his hands don't leave them, if you
       know what I mean.

>        "I'll keep that in mind," Morris said.  "Oh and my second
>officer wants to know if you and his son had a good time last night.  
>Apparently Jay came home dead tired."

Mike: (as Morris) And wearing a duck costume.  We must ask him about it
        sometime.

>        "Yes, we did," Marrissa said.  "Although I don't recommend
>dancing to midnight and then taking the bridge at 0800 the next mourning.  
>I've discovered why my father drinks so much Earl Gray tea."

Crow: It's made with 50 percent tea leaves, and 50 percent model airplane 
        glue!

Tom: (as Morris) We gotta help Fred and Barney down at the Qari.

>Epilogue

>        "Marrissa, you are too busy for a girl your age," Admiral Picard

Crow: Hey, didn't we read this already?

>        "Most girls my age aren't Starfleet Lieutenants or heirs to the

Tom: Yeah!  This was the start of the story!  We did this one years ago!

>        "True but even so you have to much work, especially paper work,"
>Jean-Luc Picard said.  "And your room is simply not the place for it."

Crow: He's looped back on himself!  Stephen Ratliff has become a Moebius
        Strip of fandom!

>        "Where else am I going to do it?" Marrissa asked.
>        "How about your office, across the hall," her father replied.

Mike: I mean, if, say, the Kids Crew and the Freedom Fighters had to swap 
        for a week or so.
Crow: Um... uh-huh.
Tom: Uh... hey... look, the epilogue!

>followed your plans exactly or I will know why."  The last was said in 
>such a tone that meant that he would not be pleased with Geordi LaForge if
>there was any deviance from Marrissa's plans.

Tom: Yes, the crew lived in constant fear of Jean-Luc sending them off to 
       the gulags.

>        "Thank you Dad," Marrissa said giving her father a hug.  "And
>you definitely are right, I'm too busy.  I think that I will leave this 
>rewrite of my evaluation of Lieutenant Szustakowski until tomorrow.  After 
>all it's not needed for another month."

Crow: (as Marrissa) But afterward, I really *do* have to count all the
        rivets in the bulkhead.  Twice.  And then I need to turn the 
        lights on and off exactly twenty-seven times, or I'll die. 

>        "In that case, would you care for a little sword practice?"
>Jean-Luc asked.
>        "I'd be delighted, Dad." Marrissa replied.

Mike: Ack!  Shame on you, Ratliff!
Crow: Been there...
Tom: Done that...

Mike: (singing to the tune of the "Davy Crockett Theme") Danielll... Daniel
        Sutter... duke of the wild frontier!

Crow: Clara couldn't have a good title, so we offered her some canned goods

Crow: It's good that he mentioned that Worf was the son of Mog... otherwise 
        we might confuse him with all the other Worfs hanging around this
        story.
Tom: Isn't he supposed to be son of Martok now actually?

[Mike and the bots stand up.]

Mike: You say "Yo-MAY-to," I say "Yo-MAH-to"....
Bots: Let's call the whole thing off!

[They exit the theater.]

[..1..]
[..2..]
[..3..]
[..4..]
[..5..]
[..6..]

[SOL]

[Mike, Tom and Crow are standing around a battered looking computer, 
 talking animatedly.]

Mike: Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
Crow: I guess...
Tom: Do you really think this will work?
Mike: Tom, it's our only hope.
[The Mads light begins to flash.]
Mike: Okay, everyone, here we go.  Take your places.
[Mike takes a deep breath and reaches over and taps the light.]

[Castle Forrester]

[Pearl, Observer and Professor Bobo gaze intently at the screen.]

Pearl: Okay, Joe Bob.  Spill it. 
Bobo:  Yes, did the old-time Ratliff fic break you or what?
Pearl: [harshly] Bobo, *I* get to find out whether or not they've 
       finally lost it! [normal] Well, Mikey?  How are you doing?

[SOL]

Mike: Okay, I guess.
Crow: I'd forgotten how badly written those early Ratliffs were.
Tom : The obsession with titles...
Mike: The creative spelling...
Crow: The way everyone is a diplomat...
Tom : The bizarre hair-ribboned aliens...
Mike: The appendices full of characters who barely appeared in 
      the story...
Crow: The royalty, and their obsession with not being royalty...
Tom : The absolute stupidity of bad guys when they capture
      someone... [Tom breaks into sobs.]
Crow: The never... ending... conferences... [He sobs too.]
Mike: Let's face it, Pearl.  It was horrible!  No mas!  No mas!

[Castle Forrester]

[Pearl is grinning from ear to ear. Bobo is passing out glasses 
 while Observer is opening a bottle of champagne.]

Pearl: So, Nelson.  It finally happened.  You've been broken!
       I knew!  I knew that one day you'd succumb to the evil 
       that is Stephen Ratliff!
Bobo: [chanting] We broke Mike's mind!  We broke Mike's mind!
Pearl: That's it then.  Brain Guy!  Let's send this puppy
       to everyone!  World conquest is mine!

[SOL]

[Tom and Crow are still crying.]
Mike: I don't think that'll work.

[Castle Forrester]

[The celebration stops as all three turn to stare at the screen.]
Pearl: What did you say?

[SOL]

Mike: I said it won't work.  The world won't be conquered.

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: Mike, I appreciate your last, feeble effort at resistance, 
       but pleeeeeze.  It's over.  Unless you have some last gasp 
       effort to save the world, that is.

[SOL]

Mike: The world doesn't need saving.  And it's all because of this!
[He gestures to the computer.]

[Castle Forrester]

[The mads sneer at Mike.]

Pearl: What are you planning to do?  Hack into NORAD and start a game 
       of Global Thermonuclear War?
[They start snickering.]
Observer: Or create a fantasy woman using the computer and a Barbie doll?
[They laugh louder.]
Bobo: Or use it to start your own Internet company, offer up an IPO, get 
      rich and then move to the Bahamas as your company falters?
[Pearl and Observer turn to stare at Bobo.]

[SOL]

Mike: Nope.  I'm just going to do this.
[Mike walks to the keyboard, types a few characters, and hits the enter 
 key with a flourish.]

[Castle Forrester]

Observer: Ooooh!  We're scared! 
Pearl: Mike, if you're trying to delete the Ratliff archive, don't bother.
       I have backup copies.

[SOL]

[The bots have stopped crying and now stand beside Mike.]
Mike: Oh, I'm afraid my plans aren't that elaborate.  I'm simply using 
      a search engine.

[Castle Forrester]

Pearl: Great.  You've mastered Webcrawler.  Pardon me, Mike, but I have a 
       world to conquer....

[SOL]

Mike: Here we go.  "Ratliff Fanclubs"... 10,662 entries.

[Castle Forrester]

[The Mads stare incredulously.]

Pearl: What?
Observer: That's simply not possible....
Pearl: He sucks!
Bobo: His stories are horrible!
Observer: Absolutely ghastly!
All: How can *HE* have fans?!

[SOL]

Mike: [Shrugs] Well, *we* may hate him, and *you* may hate
      him, but Stephen's the biggest thing in entertainment
      these days.
Crow: Yeah, he even collaborated with Andrew Lloyd Webber!
Tom : He's huge, Pearl.  Huge!
[Mike and Crow stare at Tom.]
Tom : Sorry.  Reflex action.
Mike: Anyway, while you've been forcing us to read Stephen's
      little stories, the rest of the world has already read 
      them and loved them!
Crow: Look at these web page titles... "Hope and Humanity: 
      The Works of Stephen Ratliff."
Tom : "A Legend Walks Among Us: A Tribute To Stephen Ratliff."
Mike: "The Nobel Committee was Beaten by a Bunch of Kids! 
       How S.B. Ratliff Won Five Nobel Prizes for Literature."
Tom : "The Magic of Marrissa!"  "Throwaway Hunters!"
Mike: www.marrissaromance.com!
Tom : www.marrissafanfic.com!
Crow: "Hot Lezbo Marrissa Action!"
Mike: Crow!
Crow: But it got five stars from the Mining Company!
Mike: Look, Pearl.  We may hate Marrissa, but to the 
      rest of the world, she's an icon to be revered.
Tom : Sending out an unknown Marrissa story would be 
      cause for celebration, not the end of the world.
Crow: Maybe if you got out of the Castle a little more often, 
      you'd know that.
Mike: So you see, your plan just won't work.

[Castle Forrester]

[The Mads look shaken.]

Pearl: How can this be?  They like him?  They really *like* him?
Bobo: Lawgiver, do you want to sit down...?
Observer: I'll get you a hot toddy....
Pearl: No. [louder] No! [normal] No, Art's right.  I've been 
       cooped up in here too long.  After all, if I can't 
       even tell what people like and don't like any more...
       [She shakes her head.] I need a vacation.  Bobo! 
       Brain Guy!  Pack the bags!  We're going to Tahoe!
       Mike?  I trust that you can hold down the fort for 
       a while?

[SOL]

Mike: Sure thing, Mrs. F.  We need to do some spring cleaning 
      anyway.  You just go ahead and enjoy yourself!

[Castle Forrester]

[Bobo, Pearl and Observer are now laden with bags and 
 wearing Hawaiian shirts.]

Pearl: Thanks, Mike.  After I get back in touch with the 
       common folk, I'll be back to resume my experiements!
       Later!  Brain Guy?  If you'll do the honors?

[The Observer's sound effect is heard, and the Mads vanish, 
 leaving behind an empty Castle Forrester.]

[SOL]

[The trio looks anxiously at the view screen.]

Tom : They're gone!
Crow: Quick Mike, delete that damn story!
Mike: I'm trying... Okay, one more and... done!
      That's every copy on the net!
Crow: Whew. 
Tom : Thank goodness. 
Crow: I can't believe Pearl fell for that.
Tom : Yeah. "The whole world's in love with Ratliff." 
      Good one, Mike.
Mike: Well, I do get flashes of inspiration from time to time.
Crow: Yeah, if Pearl had bothered to check those webpages, 
      she'd have seen that all of them were just "Dawson's Creek" 
      sites that we'd renamed.
Tom : By the way, Mike?  Shouldn't you be renaming them back?
Mike: Nah.  They'll all be "Felicity" sites in a few weeks anyway.
      Still, I'd better make sure that all those Royal Mess stories 
      are gone.... "Royal Mess 1: No match found."... "Royal Mess 2: 
      No match found."  We did it!
Crow: Pearl nearly got us with that one. 
Tom : Yep.
Mike: Well, guys.  We don't have to worry about that anymore.
      We've finished a Ratliff story that hung over our head 
      for years.  We've saved the world, and Pearl's out of 
      our hair for a few weeks until she realizes that we 
      conned her.  Not bad for a day's work, huh?  Now, what
      do you say we go get some ice cream sodas, huh?
Crow: Sure thing!
Tom : Let's go!

[Mike wraps his arms around the bots, and they exit the 
 right side of the bridge, laughing.  Cambot pans down to
 the computer that is left unattended on the control panel
 and zooms in as the scene fades to...]
