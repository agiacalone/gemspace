[Season 10 Opening]

[The Bridge of the Satellite of Love]
[Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo are busily playing a board game.]

 Tom: Okay, my turn. And four. One... two... three... and four!
      Draw a card. "Discover the true nature of reality. Gain
      a follower and roll again." Hah!
Crow: Yeah, yeah. [to the camera] Hi everyone and welcome to
      the Satellite of Love. I'm Crow T. Robot and my
      cohort here is Tom Servo. 
 Tom: ...and three. "What is life? Is it meaningless, devoid
      of content, or is there a master plan, unbeknownst to
      us all? Roll again."
Crow: Tom and I are busily playing "Philosopher: the Board
      Game!" Tom inexplicably has taken a very slight lead.
 Tom: Pshaw. I'm almost to "Enlighted One", while you're
      stuck back in "Wrestling Fan".
Crow: Hey! Wrestling is just a modern day morality
      play! It's nothing to be ashamed of! Plus Stone 
      Cold kicks ass!
 Tom: Right, Crow. [Rolls a die.] Four! [Tom moves his
      piece.] "Consider 'If'." How profound.
Crow: I'll catch up soon, Tom. [softer] Just as soon as my
      guy stops watching TV on his couch.
[Mike enters, grinning devilishly.]
Crow: Hi Mike.
 Tom: Hi.
Mike: Guys! Someone set up us the bomb!
[The bots turn to Mike, looking concerned.]
 Tom: Um, pardon?
Mike: We get signal!
Crow: Are you feeling okay?
Mike: All your base are belong to us!
[The bots slump and return to their game.]
 Tom: Oh. That.
Mike: All your base are belong to us!
Crow: We heard you, Mike.
Mike: Come on, guys! All your base are belong to us!
 Tom: Mike, it's over.
Crow: Yeah, that phrase is just so... not now.
Mike: What do you mean it's over? I just heard it!
Crow: Well, some of us have known about it for
      months, if not years now.
 Tom: By the time you've heard it, it's become
      incredibly unhip to us. We've moved on.
Mike: Oh.
[Mike exits, head hung low.]
 Tom: Some people.
Crow: Yep. My turn! Two! "You realize Springer's 
      on. Move back five." Blast!
[Mike rushes back in.]
Mike: All your base are belong to us!
Crow: Still not funny, Mike.
Mike: I thought it was.
Crow: You liked that "Who Let the Dogs Out?"
      song too.
[Mike exits again.]
Crow: Will he ever learn? Repeating the same
      phrase over and over again just isn't
      funny, right Tom?
 Tom: Yep. It stinks!
[The bots begin to crack up.]
Crow: Where wolf? There wolf!
 Tom: CHIEF!
Crow: MC CLOUD!
[The pair is laughing loudly now as the commercial
 sign begins to flash.]
 Tom: I'M HUGE!
Crow: Why don't they look?
 Tom: Grignir?

[The Planet bumper.]
[Commercials]

[The bots are still laughing as Mike walks back in.]
Mike: Okay, I think I've got a new one. "Monkey Sugar."
      It means...
Crow: [restraining his laughter] ...that something
      is incredibly cool. Like, "Memento was so
      Monkey Sugar!"
 Tom: Heard it. Moved on.
Crow: Get with the times, Mike.
[The lights signaling a call from Castle Forrester 
 begin to flash.]
Mike: Great, Faith Popcorn is calling.
[Mike hits the button and the scene shifts to...]

[Castle Forrester]
[In the background, Professor Bobo is busily 
 rooting around in a file cabinet. In the foreground,
 Observer, wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap
 and noisily chewing gum, is busily working on a
 computer. Between the two, Pearl is pacing anxiously.]
Pearl: Anything?
Bobo: [with his head in a drawer] No luck here.
Pearl: Brain Guy?
Observer: Still lookin'.
[She turns to the camera.]
Pearl: Mitch. Robots. We're, uh, having a little
       problem down here with this week's experiment.
       Namely we can't find one.

[SoL]
 Tom: Really? What a shame.
Crow: Yep. We're heartbroken.
Mike: Say, the Brak Show's kinda neat...
Crow: It's in reruns already, Mike. Old news.

[Castle Forrester]
Pearl: Bobo's scouring through the print archives,
       to no avail. Movie-wise, well, after this 
       last summer we've got too many to choose 
       from. And Brain Guy can't find anything 
       on the net. It's weird. It's almost as 
       if all of the authors have disappeared.

[SoL]
Mike: Really? That is odd. 
[A loud thump emanates from off screen.]

[Castle Forrester]
Pearl: What was that?

[SoL]
Mike: Oh, I'm sure it was nothing important.
      I'll go take a look though.
[Mike grabs a conveniently placed baseball bat
 and exits to the right.]
Crow: So, I guess this means no experiment for
      us today then, right?

[Castle Forrester]
Pearl: [Sighing] It's beginning to look that way.
       I guess that all good...
Observer: Bingo.
Pearl: You found something?
[She moves over to watch Observer over his
 shoulder.]
Observer: You betcha. I was diving through the
          old Usenet archives and I found...
          this!
[He dramatically punches a button. Pearl looks
 at the screen and smiles evilly.]

[SoL]
[A series of loud thumps can be heard off screen.]
Bots: Uh-oh.

[Castle Forrester]
Pearl: Oh, this is good.
Observer: Yep. Somehow we missed this one. 
Pearl: Well, our loss then is our profit now.
[She turns towards the camera, grinning.]
Pearl: You're going to love this one. It seems
       we've discovered a forgotten tale of
       a certain Starfleet Captain.

[SoL]
Crow: Oh no.
 Tom: You don't mean...

[Castle Forrester]
Pearl: Yep. Marrissa Amber Flores Picard.

[SoL]
Crow: But, but, how?
[Mike enters. He holds the now broken in half
 bat in his hand.]
Mike: Found it. It was the washing machine.
      Yeah. The washing machine.
 Tom: But we've read all of Ratliff's stuff!
      Even those [shudder] adult ones! Unless
      he's written new ones!
[Tom turns towards Mike, who shakes his head.]
Mike: No, he's still trapped in the storm cel...
      er, no, I mean he's probably busy in his
      post-college career.

[Castle Forrester]
Pearl: Oh, it's not from Stevie. It's written by
       one of his fans.

[SoL]
 All: Uh-oh.

[Castle Forrester]
[In the background, Bobo's upper torso is completely
 in one of the drawers. His legs are pumping furiously.]
Pearl: Yep. Uh-oh. So, get ready for Thomas Keeler's
       Marrissa piece, "Before the Dawn". Send them
       the fic, Brainy.       
Observer: Word.
      
[SoL]
[The lights have begun to flash.]
Mike: [whispering] Pearl? What's up with Observer?

[Castle Forrester]
Pearl: Oh, he's just trying to establish some street cred.

[SoL]
Mike: Oh. Well, I guess WE'VE GOT MARRISSA SIGN!!!
[Mike hits the light, and the door sequence begins.]

[6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . .]

[The crew enters and sits.]
Crow: So what exactly happened?
Mike: Oh, they were using a fork to scratch a 
      story into the bulkhead. [Shudders] A
      crossover between "Hannibal" and "The 
      Gummy Bears" with a bit of "The Music Man" 
      tossed in.
 Tom: Lovely.
Mike: Oh, and Pete's back in the cooler again.
Crow: Figures.

>From captain@work.matrix Sun Nov 01 19:02:59 1998

 Tom: Is Keanu Reeves going to be in this?
Mike: [deeply] Take the blue pill, Neo, and all will
      be as it was. Take the red pill and you'll
      start writing fanfic.

 Tom: Comma Ten.

 All: Oh no.
 Tom: Bad sign...
Crow: Mike, I don't know if I can take another
      first effort...
Mike: Just hunker down. We'll make it through it.
      It was nice of him to warn us though.

>                                              and I've 
>chosen a very tenuous starting point,

 Tom: Very bad sign...
Mike: [Iblis] It started with "THIS STORY IS A SUPER KEWL 
      CROSSOVER BETWEEN TOMB RAIDER AND PERFECT DARK!!!"
Crow: AHHHH!!!!
 Tom: You're not helping, Mike.

>                                      right after a story 
>still in progress.

 Tom: A very, very bad sign.
Mike: [gulps nervously] Keep it together, guys. We've got
      to be strong.

>                    This takes place in the Ratliff

Crow: Eef!
 Tom: Hey, look! Four horsemen are approaching!
Mike: Okay, forget what I said. Commence panicking.

>         (thank you, Stephen),

 Tom: [falsetto] o/~ Thank you, thank you Ratliff! o/~
Mike: Tom? Stop bringing that up. Please?
Crow: [snicker] Say, Tom? Did we ever take those pictures
      of Mike singing that down from the website?
 Tom: We replaced them with a mpeg, remember?
[Mike whimpers.]

>                               from the perspectives of the 
>crew of Deep Space Nine.

Crow: Who would no doubt give Marrissa yet another title to
      add to her list.
 Tom: Specifically, from Odo's pot's view.
Mike: You're never going to get over "Chakotay's Pillow" 
      are you?

>                          This sets the scene for a number

Crow: You can't threaten me like that! I laugh in the face 
      of your future works! HA!

>                    which I hope you'll like. If you want 
>to MiST, just ask.

 Tom: Because using body spray is vital in today's fast
      paced world.

>Vivat Marissa ad aeturnum!

Crow: What's that?  "Vivisect Marrissa at the sternum"?
Mike: It means "May Marrissa live forever."
Crow: I like mine better.

 Tom: I've always suspected but now I have proof.

 Tom: Maybe now they should change that name. Like,
      oh, say, alt.startrek.boredom or 
      alt.startrek.cannon-fodder.

>Subject: NEW TNG Before the Dawn [PG] Part 1/4

Crow: Just four parts? I was expecting the usual
      10 or 15.
Mike: Don't pressure him, Crow.

>From: Iblis <captain@work.matrix>

Crow: So, how many groupies does Ratliff have now?
 Tom: Let's see. There's that Generations 2 girl,
      but she insists she's not a groupie.
Mike: That Marrissa's the Borg Queen guy.
 Tom: Oh, there's that Marrissa meets John McClaine
      story.
Crow: And Dark Marrissa! Don't forget that one!
Tom: Of course, there was that Marrissa gets killed
     by Han Solo and another Mary Sue character.
Crow: The "Marrissa Flores on Basilisk Station"
      story.
 Tom: That goofy, unfinished round robin.
Crow: And that "Marrissa of Gor" story.
 Tom: And don't forget that retrocon story where 
      Marrissa was Riker's niece and she was half-elven
      and caused all of the characters to start boinking
      each other...
Mike: Guys? I don't remember reading half of those.
      [mumbling] Especially that last one.
 Tom: Oh. Well, forget we said anything then.

Mike: Doesn't he mean the "Next Generation"?

Crow: After all, now Berman would have to come up with a 
      new bunch of humans in funny costumes to torment 
      the Trek cast.

>     Admiral Benjamin Sisko sat back heavily.

Crow: Putting on a little weight, are we?
 Tom: Joe Don Baker is SISKO!

>                                               For whatever 
>reason, his office on Deep Space Nine felt strangely alien.  

Tom: [Sisko] Hmm. When did I put all of this secreted resin
     around my office?

>He had sat there, in that chair, countless times over the 
>last decade and a half,

Crow: [Sisko] Oh, now I know why I feel odd! This chair 
      hasn't been Febrezed.

>                        dealing with every conceivable 
>threat to the Federation,

Mike: Right now, Sisko was figuring out how to protect us
      from killer space-going aardvarks.

>                          from Dukat to the Dominion, from 
>Q to Klingons.

 Tom: Well, there goes the alliteration.
Crow: From time anomalies to temporal rifts! From Rick 
      Berman to Michael Dorn! He dealt with them all!

>                For every decision he made,

 Tom: Millions died and whole civilizations were destroyed.
Crow: [Sisko] Do I supersize this order and risk the
      destruction of Betazed?

>                                            his office had 
>been a kind of retreat --

Mike: Only without the chips and dip and the recliners 
      and...

>                          unchanging, homey.

Mike: Word!

Crow: So Chevron's still around in the future?
 Tom: [on phone] Murray? Tom Servo. Sell all my stock in 
      Texaco. Now.

>                                                    felt

Crow: [Sisko] You oppressive Starfleet badge! Take that 
      you oppressive piece of oppressive oppression!

>            like visitors to his personal space who had 
>long overstayed their welcome.

Mike: Mother-in-law: The Next Generation!

>                                Part of it, he knew, was 
>the haunting guilt over what he had done, over what he had 
>been ordered to do.

Crow: He still awakes in the middle of the night screaming,
      "Not the clown suit! Not the clown suit!"

>     He leaned forward, massaging his temples.  Starfleet 
>hadn't seemed right for him,

Mike: So he'd broken off the engagement and returned 
      the ring.

>                             until he came here, to Bajor.  

 Tom: [Announcer] And now YOU too can experience Starfleet
      at its best! 

>Even before Jennifer -- his first wife -- died at Wolf 359 
>all those years ago, the uniform hadn't quite fit.

Crow: That's because Jennifer was a lousy seamstress.

>                                                    He 
>closed his eyes.

 Tom: [Sisko] Fear is the mind killer, fear is the 
      little death that brings total oblivion...

>     When they opened again, he was standing on the 
>recreation deck of the Livingston, one of his earliest 
>assignments.

Crow: Paula!!!!
Mike: Where did *that* come from?
Crow: I'm not really sure...

>              He was in full dress uniform,

 Tom: I oughta talk to the Starfleet fashion designer 
      about that.

>                                            and Jennifer . 
>. . Jennifer!

 Tom: [Sisko] JENNIFERRRRR!
Mike: Not that way, Tom.
 Tom: Oh.

>               She was in her wedding dress, as beautiful 
>as he had ever seen her.  And Curzon was there -- the Old
>Man himself, grinning happily.  Captain Wallace was saying 
>something.

Mike: Has anyone seen Grommit?
 Tom: And this is 60 Minutes.
Crow: Freeeeeedom!

>     "Do you, Benjamin Lafayette Sisko . . ."

Crow: [Wallace] Wear boxers or briefs?

>     "I do," Sisko said, not waiting for the question, just 
>like he had thirty years before.

Tom:  Yeah, he's impatient like that.
Crow: [Wallace] I see... well, I'll put you in for both.

>     "Are you Benjamin Sisko?"

Crow: Great. Sisko's getting a subpoena in the middle of his
      wedding. How tacky.
Mike: [Columbo] I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir. But I just
      need to ask you a few questions...

>     That wasn't right.  "I beg your pardon?"  He looked at 
>Wallace.
>     "You are the Sisko."  Jennifer said, stepping in.

Crow: [Sisko] Oh no, not another vision. Look, can't you go bug 
      Barclay or something? He loves his little fantasy life!

>     Of course.

 Tom: Wha?

>                 It had seemed a little too real for a 
>daydream.

 Tom: Oh, he's stoned again.

>           The Bajoran Prophets

Crow: A really intense death-metal group!
 
>                               -- aliens who lived in a 
>wormhole outside the spacetime continuum

Mike: That sounds kind of cramped.

>                                         -- were trying to 
>reach him.

 Tom: Just to recap for those who have been in a coma for
      over seven years.

>            While sometimes helpful and occasionally 
>pleasant, Sisko had always found the Prophets' visions of 
>his most emotionally intense moments . . . invasive.

Crow: And we all know how pleasant that can be.
Mike: Tonight's DS9 episode "Sisko gets an anal probe" will
      be right back.

>     "What do you want?"

Crow: [Prophet] We want the Sisko to stop dying his hair 
      silver and singing about thongs.

>                           He sighed, attempting to be 
>diplomatic, once more disregarding modern Starfleet policy.

Mike: [dramatically] To hell with policy! He's going to
      be... diplomatic!

>     "What do you want?"  Curzon demanded back of him.  

Mike: [Sisko] For you to go away and let me sulk for once!

>"You lack direction.

Mike: [Curzon] Find the one known as Berman.

>                      For you, the game is over."

Crow: [Sisko] Knew I should have bought Boardwalk....

>                                                   Faces 
>began changing shape all around him:

Mike: Hey, looks like Ben did a bit too much LDS during 
      the 60s too!

>                                     Jennifer became 
>Kasidy, Curzon became Jadzia, then Ezri.

 Tom: Then, for some reason, Mexico President Vincente 
      Fox.
Mike: That little alien symbiont sure likes people with
      z's in their name.
Crow: The thing I like about fan-fiction is that there are
      no behind-the-scene problems with the cast.
 Tom: You're just saying that because you got to see Jadzia.
Crow: Nuh-uh!

>                                          Kira, Jake, Quark 
>-- a lifetime of familiar people drifted across his 
>mindscape.

Mike: Hey! There's Spencer!
Crow: And Edward Norton!
 Tom: And there's Trumpy, Joel... and look! Dr. Erhardt's 
      playing chess with Gamera in the corner!
Mike: He meant Sisko's lifetime, Tom.

>     "The Sisko must choose."

Crow: [Sisko] Alright, if you say so. Eeny meeny miny mo...

>     "Choose?  Choose what?"

Mike: [surly] Cash or annuity. Geez Hawk, just buy the 
      damn lotto ticket and move along!

>                              He held his head, trying to 
>keep from being overwhelmed.

 Tom: Ah. "Kid at Disneyland" syndrome.

>                              As soon as he asked, he 
>realized his mistake:

Crow: Never throw sodium in water during a gas leak.

>                      never ask the Prophets a direct 
>question.

 Tom: Yeah, ask them indirect questions like 'If the
      sum of pi and x equal the square root of y, what 
      am I supposed to choose?'

>     "Life or Salvation.  Truth or Loyalty.

Mike: Regular or diet.

Mike: Are Caldonian eels the fat slow ones with the dry
      rubbery skin?
Crow: No, I think they're the little slippery ones that 
      swim real fast.
Mike: Of course. Thus, making them hard to grasp. Let's
      move on.

Mike: Well, some of us have.

Mike: Silence echoed?

>It was as uncomfortable as ever.

 Tom: [Sisko] Maybe I should turn off that Hanson

 Tom: Ah, characterization.
Crow: Well, from the first couple seasons anyway....

 Tom: The link was just giving 404 errors anyway.

Mike: I wonder if he ever heard of the notion that in 
      war, people die.
Crow: Intergalactic wars? High cost in lives? Hmm, never 
      thought of that.
 Tom: I guess he expected a nice clean little game of

      a copy of "Logan's Run".
Crow: Oh.

Mike: Um, not many?
 Tom: And who the heck is mourning for Adonis?

Crow: Um, okay. So the more casualties, the more tears?

Mike: Early thirties, science officer... that narrows it down.
 Tom: Well, it rules out Doctor McCoy.

Crow: Is that what you kids call it nowadays?

 All: Syral?
 Tom: Heck, why not? We haven't had a new recurring cast 
      member on DS9 for almost two or three episodes now.

Crow: [Quark] I just conveniently bring them up.

 Tom: [Quark] Well, the Nagus' just added new social 
      programs as part of his new reforms, and I'm taxed
      silly for them, so there!

>     Quark shrugged.  "Business is business.  Profits make

>     "How've you been, Dax?"  Bashir asked, ignoring the
>confrontation.

 Tom: What confrontation?
Mike: Morn finally saw his bar tab and took everyone 
      in the bar hostage.

>     "Not so bad actually.  You heard about the Gorkon?"

Crow: Yeah! Hundreds of skinny fanboys in leather miniskirts!

>     Bashir nodded.  "I'm sorry.  We were glad to hear your 
>crew escaped."
>     Syral patted his stomach softly.  "Most of us."

Mike: [Syral] I ate the rest of 'em.

>eulogy for his former host.

Mike: Which was...?
Crow: Ezri?
 Tom: I don't think it was old "Big Head." Stephen never
      mentioned her. It might have been Jadzia.
Crow: Heck, it might have even been Curzon. I don't think
      that he mentioned Jadzia either.
[Silence.]
Mike: Dear lord. We remember what's canon in the 
      Ratliff-verse and what's not. We've read waaaay 
      too many of these.

>                             Finally, he sighed.  "We were 
>lucky.  Before you go eulogizing the Romulans, Julian, we 
>lost some good people.  Remember Captain Kinsmore?"

Mike: Um, yeah. He was the guy who sold fish sticks, right?

>     "The USS Georgia.  Who could forget?

 Tom: Remember when all the lights went out?

>                                           I'm just glad 
>*I* didn't make the discovery."

Mike: Who knew he was really Rosie O'Donnell in drag?

>     Dax rubbed the back of his neck, uncomfortably.  "A 
>modern Mary Celeste.  Every man, woman, and child . . . 

 Tom: Disappeared after it was bought by Benjamin Briggs?

>that was the worst part.  The pilot was just a little 
>girl."

Crow: Briggs was a little girl?

>     The doctor agreed.  "Makes me wish we never had Kids'

Mike: That's it! We have entry into the Ratliffverse!
Crow: May God have mercy on our souls.
 Tom: And only now he's objecting... hey buddy, we've been 
      wishing that since "Enterprized".

>        Children should be kept safe on the core worlds,

Crow: Keep them in safe places like Sarajevo, or Beirut,
      or Detroit.

>     "I can't object to the new ranking system, though," 

Mike: [O'Brien] They know where I live.

>O'Brien said, rejoining the conversation.  "Now that 
>officers don't all have to be Academy trained . . ." 

 Tom: Yeah! Why bother with professional training and 
      teaching them ethics? Let's have an underaged
      paramilitary!

>                                                     he 
>tapped the Lt. Commander insignia on his collar.  "Still, I 
>don't want Yoshi or Molly out there."

Crow: Yoshi? That dinosaur can defend itself.

>     The Trill pursed his lips.  "I don't think this has to 
>do with Kids' Crews,"

Mike: [Syral] Though if you want to argue about the Kids' 
      Crews, I won't mind.

>                      he said skeptically.  "Personally, I 
>think the intelligence report was faked."

Crow: 'Cause we all know there's no *intelligence* in the
      military! [pause] Well, someone had to say it.

>     Quark, Bashir, and O'Brien leaned in closer.  Why fake 
>an intelligence report *after* the war was over?

 Tom: Because Starfleet was so lazy that they put it off 
      until the last minute?
Mike: To keep K'n St'rr off of President Jaresh-Inyo's 
      trail?
Crow: Just cuz it's fun?

>     "Well, as I see it, there are three possibilities," 
>Dax asserted.  "One, it begins a relief effort to Romulus, 
>placing Starfleet operatives at the heart of the Empire.  
>Two, it conceals the Federation's own weakened state after 
>the last two wars -- especially considering our current 
>relations with the Breen, and even the Klingons."

Crow: [Syral] And three, it makes Marrissa look good!

>     "For a warrior race, they certainly did take their 
>sweet time to jump in," Quark noted.

Mike: The Klingon High Council's mother had told them to
      wait half a year after eating before jumping into 
      the war.
 Tom: Besides, the Romulans had those nasty attack
      tribbles.

>     "And," Bashir added, "Starfleet voiced an official 
>protest for their decimation of four star systems.

Crow: Hey, maybe Mike's a Klingon.
 Tom: Yeah "Starkiller", maybe you've got some Klingon 
      blood in you.
Mike: I do not! And those were all accidents, I swear.

Mike: [Bashir] Personally, I'd have told them to eat a 
      tribble but that wouldn't have  been diplomatic.

>has no jurisdiction in the matter."

Crow: Unless they decide otherwise.

>"Worf said Kurn was a little angry about the massacre, 
>himself."

 Tom: [Syral] But Worf? He absolutely LOVES it! He said 
      he killed fifty!

>     "You said three possibilities," O'Brien prompted.

 Tom: [Syral] Did I say that? Oops.

>     Dax nodded.  "It's the third reason that has me most 
>concerned." He glanced around, as though Section 31 was

Mike: [Syral] Like self-replicating lava lamps!

 Tom: Sorry! First day at the docking controls.

Crow: A sound that he recorded and played endlessly over 
      the bridge speakers.

Mike: I love the sound of clunking metal in the morning.
      It sounds like victory.

 Tom: Now he can loosen _his_ belt.

      scavenger hunt?

Mike: Oh my God, they converted the Defiant into a 
      retirement ship!
 Tom: [elderly tone] What? Pass me that ear trumpet, I can 
      hardly hear ya!

Mike: [Nog] Sorry, sir. I was just keeping it warm for you.

Mike: [Nog] Saaay, she's cute. And wow! Look at the caboose
      on *that* guy!

>                                  or rather, the lack of

  Tom: Well, you see, there was this giant white rabbit...

>       For the first time since he had been issued command

Mike: Yep. No need to worry about incoming ships. No need
      to worry about pirates and criminals sneaking in...

>       Either that, or we lost and nobody told me.

Crow: So, Nog just spent some time on a deserted Pacific
      Island then?
 Tom: Uh... but then the war would still be over, 
      wouldn't it?

Mike: Oh! He's getting old! Quick! Replace him with a six
      year-old!

Mike: But he was the right age for an ancient Starfleet

Crow: Wow, yet another title to put after her name! Thank
      you fanfic, thank you!

>                was having one of the worst days of her 
>life.

Mike: After she lost the position of "Head of all Kid's 
      Crews in Starfleet", life just seemed meaningless
      to her.

>       Not only had Starfleet found it necessary to ship 
>her off to this hellhole,

Mike: They also ORDERED her there!
 Tom: We feel your pain, Marrissa. It's not everyday people
      like you HAVE to take orders!

>                          but they couldn't even
>appoint her a decent secretary!

Crow: Starfleet must be getting their secretaries from the 
      same place that Murphy Brown uses.

>                                 She sighed angrily, trying 
>to stare down the stacks of paper around her.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Take that, papers! Feel the wrath of my heat
      vision!

>                                               A phaser set 
>on ten would probably do the trick . . .

Crow: [Marrissa] I might even kill an innocent Romulan while
      I'm at it!

>     She shook her head.  It had to be done,

Mike: Yes, she really *had* to shake her head!

>                                             authorized, 
>and sent off as soon as possible -- a term Starfleet 
>defined as "yesterday."  Why couldn't it all be on PADDs?  
>She wondered.  She already knew the answer.

 Tom: It was 12.
Crow: [Marrissa] Those idiots sent me here to do useless 
      work so I can't go off on another genocidal war!

>                                             The planetary 
>computer network had crashed during the final siege on 
>Romulus, and millions of records were destroyed

Mike: The Stardate 2k problem strikes!

>                                                -- this was
>just what had been recovered today.

 Tom: [Marrissa] They mustn't know my weakness for Quake...

>     At least she didn't have to worry about coordinating 
>Kids' Crews anymore.

Crow: Those new taupe uniforms would go with anything!

>                      Her sister Jackie had been good 
>enough to take the reins,

 Tom: She had the total lack of compassion down, but she 
      could have been more sadistic.

>                          letting Marrissa get back to this 
>oh-so-important desk.

Mike: You mean... [dramatic] THE DESK?

>                       Stretching, her stomach muscles 
>tightened; they were almost back to normal,

Crow: [Marrissa] That Jenny Craig fellow can stuff it,
      I can workout by myself!

>                                            but
>she still had to treat them tenderly after the pregnancy.
>     Sara had finally gotten to sleep around four AM, 
>planetary time.

 Tom: 4:30 in Newfoundland.

>                 If Marrissa hadn't still been on 
>Enterprise time, she certainly wouldn't be awake, much less 
>in a black mood.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Daddy, do your little daughter a favor and
      get rid of time zones altogether so I can nap!

>                  A reflection of sunlight caught her eye.  

Crow: [Marrissa] You're next sun....

>At least she had a window.

 Tom: Unfortunately, it looked out onto a parking lot.

>                            Picard swiveled her chair, and 
>found that someone still hadn't cleaned the glass.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Damn it, Jay. Get your butt over there!

>                                                    A
>small streak of green blood, hardly noticeable at first, 
>seemed to scream at her after the last few days.

Mike: The souls of the damned have finally caught up to 
      her.

>                                                  It was 
>the only reminder that someone had occupied the office 
>before her.

Crow: Well, that and the dead bodies stacked up like 
      cordwood.

>             Mud clots dotted the pane on the outside, and 
>the acid rain had made it streak, badly.

Mike: Can't you Romulans streak right for once?

>                                          Not that there 
>was anything left to see, really.  The courtyard had been
>trampled, the tree was downed, and someone had graffitied 
>something in Romulan script on the wall.

 Tom: [Marrissa] What's that? "I was beaten by a bunch of"
      - how's that for irony?

>     Marrissa groaned.

Crow: [Marrissa] Foolish peasants...

>                        It wasn't enough that the Romulans 
>killed her parents, or started a war, or destroyed the 
>Enterprise-E;

Mike: It wasn't enough they had the worst fashion sense...

>              now they had to go and make it personal.  

Crow: So killing her parents doesn't make it personal?

>Unsigned death threats had a way of appearing outside, 

Mike: [chipper] Here's some more death threats for ya, 
      Ms. Picard!
 Tom: [Marrissa, grumbling] Just throw 'em on the pile.

>although fortunately no-one had yet had the sense to send a 
>bomb by the same covert means.

Crow: Hey! I did too!
[Tom and Mike turn to stare at Crow.]
Crow: Whoops. Hey! Breasts!
Mike: Crow!!!!
Crow: [Mumbles] Works every time.

>                                Yet.  Every time she walked
>through the street, eyes burned into her accusingly

Crow: [Marrissa] Romulans have stronger heat vision than I
      do! Curses!

>                                                    -- not 
>that she walked the streets often, or even very far.  These 
>people hated her as much as she did them.

 Tom: Well, she did destroy their empire after all.
Crow: But not as much as *we* do!

>                                           The late 
>praetor, Provik, said their ghosts would haunt her;

 Tom: In fact, she expected the first this Christmas Eve...

>                                                    they 
>seemed to be doing well.

Mike: Thankfully, Marrissa had an unlicensed proton pack
      and a beach kit, so she was ready for them.

>                          Thank goodness this was only a 
>temporary assignment, she thought.

Crow: [Marrissa] Otherwise, if and when I become the 
      supreme leader, I'll send those idiots here!

>     Things were looking up when she noticed a memo from 
>her father, Jean-Luc Picard.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Oh, daddy's still alive? I didn't know 
      that! Good for him!

>                              As Chief Admiral of 
>Starfleet,

 Tom: [Marrissa] No wait, that's a bad thing, isn't it?

>           he could communicate with her as often as he 
>deemed necessary.

Crow:  Which for his sake, wasn't often.

>                   Now that she was in the heart of the 
>former Romulan Empire, he deemed so just about daily. 

Crow: In fact, Jean-Luc just replaced John Stewart the 7th 
      as the host of the Daily Show.

>This particular communique, however, was an approval of her 
>request for additional security.

Mike: So they issued her a fuzzy blue blanket.
 Tom: Are they there for security or for target practice?

>                                  Two hundred armed 
>security personnel were going to be arriving in a few days; 
>they would be spread out across the planet,

Crow: Yep, just thin, greasy smears on the landscape.
 Tom: Starfleet said they'd "drop them off at Romulus," 
      and they weren't kidding!

>                                            but it at least 
>make her feel better.

 Tom: [Marrissa] More people to order around! Yay!

>     What didn't help was yesterday's arrival.

Mike: It turns out Hanson just makes them surly.

>                                                Four 
>temporal investigations officers had arrived, to make 
>certain no sling-shots, time-portals, or temporal devices 
>were used either in conquering the planet,

Mike: If the planet's already been conquered, aren't they
      a little late for that?
Crow: Of course not. They're the time squad!

>                                           or would be used 
>by Romulans for re-taking it.

 Tom: Whoops. They're forgetting about the time-traveling
      VW bugs. 

>                               Worse, six of the elite 
>Section 31 forces supposedly landed at the same time.  An
>admiral in her own right,

Mike: Her right, their wrong.

>                          and the daughter of Starfleet's
>Commander-in-Chief, Marrissa knew of Section 31, but had 
>never encountered them personally --

 Tom: [Marrissa] They seem like nice people. I wish I 
      could invite them over for some poker.

>                                     so far as she was 
>aware.

Mike: [dramatic sting]

>        Whatever their clandestine mission, Picard was sure 
>she wouldn't like it.

 Tom: Unless it involved lots of puppies!

>     Still feeling dark, she slumped in her chair, once 
>again trying to burn the paper with her gaze.

Crow: [Marrissa] Alright, papers. This planet ain't big 
      enough for the both of us...

>     Odo was having a fantastic day.

 Tom: [Odo] The things you can do with plastics!

>                                      In three hours, he 
>had managed to capture four mercenaries wanted for 
>smuggling narcotic crystals,

Crow: o/~ Three rednecks, o/~

>                             two petty crooks,

Crow: o/~ And a nudist running around free! o/~

>                                               and insult 
>Quark half a dozen times.

Mike: Now he was ticketing Vedeks on the promenade for 
      proselytizing without a license.
Crow: Later, he was going to set up a speed trap out by the
      wormhole, just in case someone violated the Warp 5 
      Speed limit.

>                           All he had to do now was monitor 
>the station, top to bottom, running security drills and 
>systems checks.  That was the boring part.

 Tom: [Odo] If Jerry Doyle and Jeff Conaway can do this with
      a smug face, why can't I?

>                                            At least it had 
>been interesting.

Mike: Wha...? The boring part had been interesting?

>                   While the Federation security guards had 
>been swarming, no-one had tried the smallest infraction. 

Crow: Well, sure. Those security guards can sting!
 
>Silly, Odo thought, the Starfleet guards were watching for 
>spies and saboteurs,

 Tom: The new role-playing game from Flying Buffalo!

>                     not smugglers and thieves!

Crow:  Ok, this isn't Odo.

>     He grunted,

Crow: This is a very grunty story. Does everyone have
      constipation or something?
Mike: Maybe he's shifted into Babe's form.

>                 crossing his arms, and leaning back 
>slightly in his chair.  The diagnostic could run on its 
>own, and Commander O'Brien could fix any system problems in 
>a matter of hours.  He'd probably be delighted.

 Tom: [O'Brien] Oh fun! Work! Thanks Odo!

>                                                 After his 
>tour on the Enterprise, he should be itching for some 
>friendly patchwork, with parts that didn't fit.

Crow: Umm... so this guy is looking for action with rag 
      dolls?

>                                                 Odo 
>himself was going to take a walk over to cargo bay 1, to 
>check Quark's latest shipment of "Bolian tea."

 Tom: I'll bet that wily mastermind Evan Lorentz is 
      behind that tea!

>                                                With any 
>luck, the constable thought, I can lock Quark up on 
>smuggling charges, too.

Mike: But it's just tea! [Pause] Oh.

>                         That would make the day complete.
>     Stepping onto the promenade, he nearly bumped into 
>Nog,

 Tom: What would bumping into Odo be like? Bumping into 
      Jell-O?
Crow: Only if he's in his goop form.

>     just entering from the outer ring.  The small Ferengi 
>scrambled to keep the case he carried from falling.

Mike: [Sports announcer] Oh, and what a save by the Ferengi,
      keeping his eye on the case at all times!
[The 'bots cheer.]

>     "Constable!"  Nog said, cheerily.
>     "Captain,"

Crow: Captain Egg Nog reporting for drinking, sir! Oops,
      I mean... shoot!

>                Odo nodded, " I trust you had a pleasant 
>vacation."  Unlike his uncle, Nog had more or less redeemed 
>himself in the Changeling's eyes -- such as they were -- by 
>joining Starfleet, and doing his best to become 
>respectable.

Mike: Little does Odo know that Quark's 'merchandise' is in
      that case he's holding right now.
 Tom: And he's giving it to Sisko?
Mike: Obvious ruse.

>     "Very much so!  While we were surveying one planet, I 
>met one of your people.

Crow: [Odo] And you literally 'had your people contact my
      people'? Don't you get it?

>                         He gave me this, for Admiral 
>Sisko."  Nog patted the box.

 Tom: [Odo] A suitcase bomb? They shouldn't have...

>     "One of . . . a Changeling gave you a present for 
>Sisko?"

Mike: [Odo] Was it Betty? She's always doing stuff like that.

>         Odo asked, startled.  "Are you sure it's benign?"  

Crow: [Nog] No, actually it's kind of petulant.

>He started to reach for it, but the captain pulled it away.

 Tom: [Nog] Hands off, goopy! It's mine!

>     "Very sure.  I opened it myself.

Mike: Cue the dramatic music!
 All: BUM-BUM-BUMMMM!!!!!

>                                       Don't worry, 
>Constable, I know the Admiral will want to be given it 
>personally.  I'm on my way there right now . . ."

Mike: [Nog] Did I mention it wasn't a trick?

>     Odo nodded again.  "Maybe I'll come with you.  I'd 
>like to see this Changeling artifact for myself."

Crow: It better not be what was in Marcellus 
      Wallace's briefcase...

>     Nog shook his bulbous head emphatically.  "This is for 
>Admiral Sisko.  If he wants to show it to you, that's his 
>choice."  The Ferengi moved off quickly, toward the 
>turbolift.

 Tom: [Odo] See you later too!
Crow: [Nog, hesitantly] I'm not planning something!
Mike: Well, that didn't raise any suspicion.
 Tom: None what-so-ever.

>     Odd, the security chief

Crow: No, his name's Odo. Two O's.

>                             thought.  He would have 
>pursued the matter, but Nog was a Starfleet Captain now, 

 Tom: And station security has no business in suspicious 
      characters who are above-rank?

>and not really subject to Odo's suspicions.  What could a 
>Changeling want to give Sisko, the man who had started the 
>war that nearly destroyed the Dominion?

 Tom: A good level 10 phaser shot on the head?
Mike: A CD Single of Britany Spears singing "Satisfaction"?

>                                         Certainly not 
>anything pleasant, but Nog said it was fine.

Crow: Then again, Nog did like those Adam Sandler 
      movies...

>                                              But who?  

 Tom: Yowch! I never thought a character's internal 
      dialog could give me whiplash.

>Maybe a renegade shape-shifter?  Someone who appreciated 
>the forced independence of the Founders?

Mike: Someone who evaded Odo for over seven years?

>                                          Uneasy, he 
>returned to his office, to watch the systems diagnostic 
>more carefully.
>

Mike: Was he afraid it would try to escape?
 Tom: [Odo] Back to watching that progress bar... 

>     Sisko called an impromptu meeting of his former crew 
>that night.

Mike: So, Sisko used to row?
Crow: He's probably a Yaley.
 Tom: You learn more about these characters everyday. 

>             Kira was the only one who had actually stayed 
>with the station the longest;

Crow: She stayed up late at night just to give it its milk.

>                              the Starfleet crew had all 
>eventually been reassigned during the war.  Admiral Sisko 
>had been commanding the Defiant more often than Nog,

Mike: Even if Admirals aren't commanders of small ships
      and they sit behind desks most of the time.
 Tom: Not in Starfleet!

>                                                     and 
>Doctor Bashir had run more relief operations than he would

Crow: [Bashir] Take that, United Nations!

 Tom: Oh my God! You blew up a Star Trek fan club! You 
      bastards!

>                                   and Lt. Commander 
>O'Brien had temporarily become the chief engineer on the 
>Enterprise.

 Tom: Just in time for Star Trek 2002: The Next Movie.

>            Conspicuously absent was Odo.

Crow: He's still waiting for his hard drive to 
      get defragged.
 Tom: Or trying to get that 'Bolian tea' Quark was so
      eager to get.
Mike: Then again, can you ever be sure he's not there?

>     "My friends," Sisko began with a smile,

 Tom: Uh oh, he's smiling. Not a good sign.

>                                             "it's been a 
>long time.

Crow: A long, lonely, lonely time.

>           A long war."

Mike: [Sisko] A long show. A long contract. A long check...

>                         He suddenly looked very serious.  
>Given the circumstances, they couldn't help but notice his 
>abrupt change.

Crow: [Bashir] Wow, he changed his facial expressions SO 
      fast! I wanna do that!

>                "Too long.

 Tom: Just a few fanfics? Please. The Hundred-Years war was 
      MUCH longer.

>                            Too many good people are dead.  

Mike: [Sisko] As well as too many bad people, but that's 
      beside the point.
 Tom: Too dead.

>And it's something I cannot in good conscience defend."

Mike: [Sisko] So I'll arrange a transporter accident and
      let the evil version of me defend it.

>     They all regarded him quizzically.  Bashir was the 
>first to speak,

Crow: [Bashir] Can I go to the bathroom?
 Tom: [Sisko] There IS no bathroom!
Crow: [Bashir] Uh oh.

>                "Admiral?  What are you saying?"

Mike: [Sisko] I'm saying, 'Julian, will you marry
      me?'

>     "I'm saying, Doctor, that I can't keep this up.  

Crow: [Sisko] So could you prescribe some Viagra 
      for me?

>Starfleet isn't the same job I signed up for.

 Tom: [Sisko] I'm not even going where no one has gone
      before anymore!

>                                               I'm sure 
>you've all noticed the changes . . ."

Mike: [Sisko] Such as that busty ex-Borg hanging around
      the station. 

>                                        He took a deep

 Tom: [Bashir] Not that I have any ambition, like 
      everybody else in this series.

Crow: [Bashir] Great, now people will make bald jokes 
      about me in a few years time.

>interrupted, only half-jokingly.

 Tom: Half-seriously?
Crow: All human.

>                                  "After being on the 
>Enterprise, the thought of spending time trying to patch

Mike: It's about the equivalent of having him hiding in 
      a bomb shelter.

>                        He chuckled.  "Actually, I 
>think I'll miss it.  The challenge, I mean."

 Tom: The challenge for O'Brien, if he's up to it, is 
      to repair three replicators - each on a corner 
      of the station - in less than 60 seconds! Go!

>     Sisko nodded.  "General Kira is being recalled to 
>Bajor in three weeks,

Mike: [Sisko] Once there, she'll lead a revolt in the 
      nation of Mesa Verde against the rule of the evil
      Senor Diego. Good luck, Generalissimo!

>                      to teach at the Militia Academy,

Crow: Ah yes, teaching them the old guerrilla tactics. 
      Washing the enemy's laundry to get information, 
      throwing Molotov cocktails at their leader's 
      motorcade. Just like old times!

Mike: [Syral] But how will I share all of my many past 
      life experiences?

>     The Trill shook his head.  "I was transferred to the

 Tom: This station is one heck of a tourist spot!

>     "The Nereus?

Crow: [Bashir] What does Mr. Sea god want?

>                   The new science vessel?  I almost took 
>that post!" Bashir lamented.  "If you told me, I could've

Mike: And then make him cook and "morale officer" when he 
      outlives his usefulness.

 Tom: [Sisko] Hi-keeba!

>        "The point I'm trying to make, is that we're at the

Mike: Okay! Cue the montage! Darren, start singing!
 Tom: Wow! It's over!
Crow: This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!
Mike: You guys *know* it's not that easy, don't you?
 Tom: [bursts into tears] I know ....

>      Our careers are winding down,

Crow: [taking one deep breath] Retirement's coming! Who 
      wants to play Bingo?

>                                    our families are moving 
>on.  Old friends are becoming few, and light-years

Mike: Star Trek DS9: The Golden Years.

>     "It's enough to make you wish for the Dominion War 
>again, isn't it, Benjamin?"  Syral asked, gently mocking.  

Crow: [Sisko] Yes! My lust for blood must be sated!

 Tom: [Syral] Speaking of which, could you pass me

Mike: Interest rates fluctuate.

 Tom: [Syral] God, why did I have to swallow that tooth?

Mike: For a guy who's not very selfish, he sure is out
      of character.
Crow: [Sisko] I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Berman.

>     "Admiral," Bashir said, thoughtfully, "what exactly do 
>you have in mind?"

Crow: [Sisko] All I can say is, it involves pudding!
[Mike and Tom murmur and nod approvingly.]

Mike: [Sisko] First, all of you need to buy e-business
      software...

>     Odo stopped.  That shouldn't be there.

Crow: [Odo] Note to self:  Never form a nose *there*

>                                             He scanned

 Tom: He's giving it the elevator look!
Crow: [Odo] Woooooo-wee! Those are some good scans!

>                                         Whatever else the 
>war had done, at least it had gotten Starfleet to upgrade

Mike: [Odo] Now if only they started scanning the station
      instead of checking out the blood flow in Quark's 
      aorta.

>                       What the constable was seeing made 
>him thankful for it.

Crow: [Odo] Now my strangle-hold over this pathetic space 
      station is insured!

>                      Someone had been trafficking in 
>subspace, recently; a lot.

Mike: Route 401's still accident-prone, is it?
 Tom: Increasing space traffic... for the future!

>                            Nearly a dozen messages had
>been sent to Bajor within the last few hours.

 All: Bum-bum-bum!
 Tom: Gosh, it sure is suspicious that a *Bajoran* station 
      is trying to contact *Bajor*.

>     Another smuggler!  The constable thought delightedly.  

Mike: Now he could complete the set!

>When they come out, they come out in force!

Crow: Whoa, are you guys getting that "World's Wildest 
      Police Videos" thing too?
 Tom: [John Bunnell] No matter what they do, no matter how 
      they try, they cannot escape the law!

>                                             He immediately

 Tom: Using onion-skin paper and a Number 2 pencil.

>great deal of trouble to hide their identity . . .

Mike: They'll probably be hitting some porn sites later.

Crow: Thanks. For a moment, I thought it was lunch time.

Crow: Is this Odo's wake-up call?
[All shudder.]

>     "Nerys!

 Tom: [Odo] Honey!

Mike: Except when he shapeshifted into a pigeon, of course.

Crow: [Kira] Are you cooing at me?

>      His edge melted away whenever they were alone, and 
>his brusque, businesslike facade dropped away.

Mike: And his gooey, Jell-O side came into being.

>     "Odo, stop your trace immediately.

Crow: You peeping Tom!
 Tom: Hey!
Crow: Not you.
 Tom: Oh.

>                                         Don't investigate

Mike: [Odo] What? Have you been calling someone? Are you 
      seeing another changeling?

>                      Delete everything your records show 
>about them, by the admiral's order."

Crow: Kira must have learned some things from Chelsea when 
      she was on the station.

>     The Changeling paused.  There was something not quite 
>right about her voice,

Mike: [Odo] She sounds like HAL 2000?

>                       regardless of her manner.  When it 
>came down to a tense situation, the general always picked 
>up in her efficiency.  "Kira, are you feeling alright?  You 
>sound . . . different."

Mike: [Odo] Did they recast you?
 Tom: How can she sound different in text format?
Crow: Just nod and accept it, Tom.

>     She swallowed.  "It's nothing, Constable.  Just a frog 
>in . . .

Crow: Her throat? No wonder she swallowed.
 Tom: [Kira] My lunch was horrid, you?

>         just a cold.  I probably picked it up from the 
>Iberian freighter captain I yelled at yesterday."

Mike: With your yelling and spitting? I think it's the 
      captain that caught the cold from you.

>     Odo nodded, slowly.  "Do you want me to arrest him on 
>criminal charges -- transporting dangerous lifeforms 
>without a permit?"

 Tom: [Odo] Carrying biological weapons? Disrupting the
      peace? Just name your charge.

>                    He asked, completely monotone.  If Kira 
>heard the humor in his voice, she didn't answer it.

Mike: Or she just didn't think it was funny.

>     "No, that's alright.  Just -- yes, sir --" she glanced 
>offscreen,

Crow: [Kira] Sponge bath it is, sir!

>           "-- just forget about the messages.  Kira out."
>     Odo started.

 Tom: Started what?
Crow: [childish] He started it!

>                   That was very peculiar.  She sounded 
>less and less like herself as the events replayed 
>themselves in his mind.

Crow: And more and more like Alanis Morisette!

>                         Whatever was in the communiques, 
>someone didn't want known.

Mike: Don't they have privacy laws?
 Tom: Not a chance.

>                            He began to delete
>the record, when he stopped to consider; they hadn't 
>forbade him to duplicate the data, first.

 Tom: But they told him not to investigate!
Mike: Well, I guess it's OK for him to copy the files as
      long as he doesn't investigate them.
 Tom: Is that what they call "ethics," Mike?

>     Within minutes, all indications of a secret 
>conversation with Bajor was completely eradicated from the

Crow: It's Odo for Cleansweep!

>           Odo tucked his PADD away into a safe alcove of 
>his office.  Maybe he could come back to it later.

Crow: [Odo] I wonder if it was a transmission to buy a gift
      for me. How thoughtful... well, back to work!

>     "Sara, honey, please!

 Tom: [Marrissa] You've shopped enough for one day!

>                            Mommy needs to sleep . . ."  
>Marrissa Picard groaned as she pulled herself out of bed 
>for the fifth time.

Crow: Ever. She rarely sleeps at all. It's what makes 
      her... unique.

>                     One change, one lullaby, and two 
>feedings in the last six hours.

Mike: And those were all for Marrissa!
 Tom: [Marrissa] I've crushed peasant uprisings and 
      smashed Romulan scum, but these babies must be
      stopped!

>                                 She hoped the baby wasn't 
>looking to nurse again -- she didn't know what she had left 
>in her.

Crow: Guts, and a black, black heart.

>         Maybe, she thought, I *should* get a nanny --

 All: NOOOOOO!!!!
Mike: In the name of all that is holy, do *NOT* bring 
      Marrissa and Fran Drescher together! PLEASE!

>                                                       I
>can't keep this up.

Crow: See guys, she *is* human.
Mike: I dunno...let's see her try to do her taxes.

>     She padded into the nursery; this room, at least, was 
>carpeted.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Thank you Alexanian Carpets!

>           It had either been a secretary's office or a 
>holding cell, but no-one had been around to tell her.

Mike: They had orders to stay 50 feet away from her while 
      she's doing paperwork.

>                                                       Sara 
>was kicking around in her crib, wailing at the top of her 
>tiny little lungs.

 Tom: I know exactly how she feels.
Crow: [Sara] I gotta get outa here! You'll never break 
      me, punk! I'll get out of this pee-pee-soaked 
      heckhole! Just you wait!

>     The admiral groaned as she heaved the small girl up, 

Mike: [Marrissa] You've been sneaking donuts behind my 
      back haven't you?

>trying to cradle her while she herself fought the urge to 
>topple.  She began to sing a gentle song,

Mike: Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
      I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the 
      bottom...

>                                          words she had 
>known all her life, from when her parents sang to her.  It 
>was old and melodious, from an old book her father -- her 
>real father -- had given her, half a lifetime ago.

 Tom: So, she was, what, six then?
Crow: It better not be a Dick Francis book. He talks more 
      about horses than Ratliff does.

>                                                   It 
>wasn't Sara's favorite.

Crow: [Marrissa] But who cares? She'll hear what *I* want to
      sing, and she'll like it!

>                         Jay's rendition of something 
>called "achy breaky" nearly always did the trick,

Mike: Nice to know that music didn't change much after 
      the 1990s.
 Tom: It could be worse. Jay could do a medley of 
      Backstreet Boys songs.

>                                                 but he 
>was millions of miles away.

Crow: He was on tour with the Plimsouls.

>                             Nevertheless, the baby slowly 
>softened her crying, clutching tightly at her mother's 
>bathrobe,

 Tom: [Sara] Hey, I wanna know the tailor for this robe.
      Silky.

>          finally putting two fingers in her mouth to suck 
>on.

Crow: [Sara] Mmmmm, finger food.

>     Picard swayed, partly to the song, partly from 
>fatigue, as her daughter quieted.  The diaper was still 
>clean,

 All: Thankfully.

>       and Marrissa hoped the little vacuum wasn't still 
>hungry.

 All: NOOOOOOO!!!!
Crow: We don't need a repeat of *that* scene either!

>         The tiny girl made a gentle contented noise,

[The 'bots imitate a Tribble sound.]

>                                                      and 
>the tension fell off her mother's shoulders.

 Tom: And the baby started crying again after the noise 
      it made.

>                                              The
>peaceful sensation that replaced it was incredible, Picard 
>thought, as she lowered Sara back into her crib.

Mike: But it was just the Ritalin kicking in.

>     Stretching, she ran her fingers through her hair, 

Mike: Then she gave that sly, come hither stare.

>letting the already disheveled follicles tangle by their 
>own accord.

 Tom:  Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.

>             She slipped back down the hall to her bedroom, 
>thankful for the hundredth time that her husband Jay was 
>still on the ship.  He had the most annoying tendency to 
>hog the covers.

Crow: And he kept hitting on her girlfriends too. Damn that Jay.

>     Lying back, the admiral closed her eyes.  Starry 
>patterns swirled and danced in her vision,

 Tom: Marrissa's screen saver's kicked in.

>                                           but . . . oh, 
>no,  she moaned.  She couldn't sleep, now.  Adjusting her 
>internal clock to Romulus was hard enough without being a 
>mother at the same time.

Mike: The moral? Jet lag and mothering don't mix.

>                          If she had to choose between
>the two, the whole planet could go to hell.

Crow: Yeah, forget the planet, Marrissa needs some shuteye.

>     She slid back out of bed, feeling terribly awake.  She 
>moved into the hall again, this time headed for her office.  

 Tom: [Marrissa] Ho hum, can't sleep. I think I'll go draft
      some legislation.

>The heavy doors loomed before her, imposing in the dark.  
>They gave way at barely a touch

Crow: [Marrissa] Whoops, don't know my own strength! Do
      I have to pay for repairs?
 
>                               -- just like these people, 
>Marrissa thought ironically -- tough and dignified from 
>outward appearances, but caving at the least provocation.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Although the war was pretty long and we 
      lost a lot of people, but these Romulans are wussies!

>     The bare marble was cold on her feet, and she huddled 
>into her robe.

Crow: Great. Now I'm picturing Marrissa as Hef at the 
      Playboy Mansion.

>                If Romulus was nippy in the day, nighttime 
>was downright arctic.

 Tom: Wait a second, wouldn't that be too cold for Romulans,
      seeing how they're related to Vulcans and all?
Mike: Let it go, little buddy.

>     At that thought, she bit her lip.  There were no 
>holodecks anywhere on the planet;

Crow: They all had Playstations instead.

>                                  if there had been, she 
>could have taken the Ellorim program, Sara, and just let 
>the Essex polar circle calm them both.  She sighed.

 Tom: I guess the primitive furnace isn't available on
      Romulus either.
Mike: They probably get their power from California, 
      Tom.

>     Sitting at the enormous desk, paperwork still 
>littering it, she opened the drawer.

Crow: [Marrissa] Yeah, this oughta be a good place to
      stuff all these papers into.

>                                      A triangular green 
>crystal lay inside 

Mike: The Triangle of Zinthar?

>                   -- the Romulan equivalent to a 
>holophoto.

Crow: Makes you wonder what their equivalent to a Polaroid
      is.

>            Shifting around the sides presented a different 
>picture, one of her father, Jean-Luc, one of Jay,

 Tom: Hawkins?
Crow: I don't hear screaming.

>                                                  one with 
>her friends when they were all together on shore leave,

Mike: [Marrissa] Although for some reason they were all 
      dog tired in the end. Maybe I didn't order them 
      around enough.

>and a beautiful portrait of the Enterprise; *her* ship.  

Crow: Wow, awfully possessive there, eh Marrissa?

>Calming, Marrissa felt ready to sleep again. 

 Tom: [Marrissa] Yes, reminders of my own power always
      soothe me...

>     She rose from her chair, just in time to hear another 
>cry from her daughter's bedroom.

Mike: [Marrissa] The little brat must be facing off against
      another assassin. You get him, honey!
Crow: Gee, is it me or is Marrissa becoming more and more 
      of a slave to Sara?
Mike: You just don't understand mothering, Crow.
 Tom: And you do?
Mike: Shut up.

>                                  Exhaustion washed over

 Tom: AAAAH! She's trying to sing Bob Dylan!
[All scream in horror.]

>     Two days later, the word came.

Crow: Oddly, the word was "shoes".

>                                      All Starfleet

 Tom: It's becoming as dangerous as the Olympic Stadium

>                                        "Sir, even if the

Mike: The desert-like Vulcan?
Crow: She's specializing in cacti.

>                           and Keiko and Yoshi are on
>Miriadis II, charting the seasonal change.

Mike: If Molly leaves Vulcan at 0600 hours, traveling at
      a speed of Warp 5, will she reach Miriadis II in 
      time for the equinox?

>                                            How --"

Crow: Utterly boring!
 Tom: I'd rather watch the grass grow. No wait, that's 
      what they're doing already.

>     "Not a problem, Chief," Sisko said, cutting him off.  
>"You retire next week.  When you're a fully unlicenced 
>civilian, you can bring them all back with you.  Syral, 
>Julian, this isn't necessarily a one-way street.

Mike: [Sisko] It's a cul-de-sac.

>is all over, you should be able to go home with total 
>impunity."

Crow: Sisko got Hugh Rodhman to arrange some pardons for
      them.

>     "And enjoy our own funerals," Bashir remarked wryly.

Mike: [cheerily] Well, sure! What's a funeral without the
      guest of honor?

>     "I've done that before.  It actually really helps the 
>family," Syral noted with complete sincerity.  "They like 
>to know that part of us lives on."

 Tom: [Bashir] That's easy for you to say, you parasitic
      worm. Oh, what did I ever see in you anyway?

>     "Then why'd you risk telling me the plan, if I'm not 
>going through with it?"  O'Brien balked.

Mike: And the runner advances to second.
Crow: Cool! Keep that DS9 baseball motif rolling!

>                                          "I've been in 
>Starfleet long enough to know what theft and desertion 
>are!"

 Tom: And I bet he knows what gross and net points are 
      too!
Mike: You have to be a Starfleet veteran to know what 
      those things are?

>     Sisko patted his shoulder.  "And loyalty.  And honor.  

Crow: Since when did Sisko turn Klingon?

>We need you to pull this off, not just for Syral and 
>Julian, but for them --" he waved his free hand back to the 
>personnel below, all individually debating whether or not 
>to stay.  "-- and for the entire Alpha Quadrant.

Mike: Gee, tone down the hyperbole, Ben.
Crow: Yeah! Saving the Alpha Quadrant was the Next Gen 
      Crew's responsibility!

 Tom: Great. We're in a campaign ad now.

>     The engineer glumly nodded.  When he looked up, he had 
>a twinkle in his eye.

Mike: And rosy red cheeks.
 Tom: Santa?
 
>                      "I wouldn't want my son becoming a 
>captain before his old man!"

Crow: [Sisko] Too late, T'Gwen Washington promoted him while
      his planet was under attack by a couple of Ferengis.

>     "You've got it -- Captain."
>     O'Brien gave him a look.  "You can't do that, sir.  
>Promote me, I mean."

 Tom: [O'Brien] I was already promoted last week! You know
      how easy it is to get into the brass these days.

>     "I'm still a Starfleet admiral.  Why the hell not?"  
>Sisko grinned widely.  "Now, get to work, Captain.  I have 
>the feeling that Starfleet won't just let this station go.  
>They've got a lot invested in it, especially with the 
>wormhole outside.  This is when things become . . .

Crow: Soon enough, DS9 stocks begin to fluctuate sending
      the war horde of Allen Greenspan into motion!

>slightest idea what they were talking about.

Mike: Join the club, pal.

>                                              Theft was his

 Tom: So it wasn't his business?

>                                                   What was

 Tom: [Odo] Hmmpf! Leave me out of a conspiracy! We'll 
      just see about that!

>     How long has this been in the works?  He wondered.  
>And why is the admiral staying behind?

Mike: Because he and Kirk Cameron have to fight the 
      anti-christ. Duh.

>                                        If there was 
>something going on here, the senior staff clearly wanted

Crow: Maybe it was the "No Odos allowed" sign on the Ops
      door had something to do with it.

 Tom: What? Walking around in a tux is generally 
      considered to be a bit suspicious!
Mike: Ahem. Vic Fontaine...
 Tom: Never mind.

>     Marrissa Picard thought she would scream if her life 
>became any more "interesting."  If she was going to be 
>military governor of this whole stupid planet, then she 
>should *stay* on the stupid planet!

Crow: Good idea! Romulus has really good schools and the 
      taxes are low!
Mike: It's a covenant controlled planet though.
Crow: Ooh. Never mind then.

>                                     But no, Starfleet in 
>its infinite wisdom, wanted her to attend a meeting at 
>Corvaldis IV, near the Cardassian border.

 Tom: So first she wants to get off the planet, now she
      wants to stay?

>     Her father could be so annoying!

Crow: [Marrissa] He never lets me barrow his car, credit
      cards, lets me go shopping or stay up 'til midnight,
      or lets me stay on the phone...

>                                       Maybe he thought it

>it would do, she knew, would be to reaccustom her with the 
>Enterprise's daily schedule!

Mike: What's her problem? At least she'll have poker night.

>     She closed her eyes.  Jay had been hoping to spend 
>more time with Sara anyway, and Marrissa was so tired . . . 
>she supposed these things wouldn't aggravate her so much if 
>it weren't *that* time of the month.

 Tom: That time...?
Mike: The cable bill's due.
 Tom: Ooooh. The Enterprise must have one hell of a big bill.

>                                      Taking a deep breath, 
>she lifted herself from the chair, part of her still 
>feeling pregnant.

Crow: Her tongue still felt pregnant.

>                   Her back, for one.

Mike: Eww... there's an unorthodox way of giving birth.

>                                       Taking a step, she
>winced.  Her ankles, she noted, for another.

 Tom: Pregnant ankles? I'm trying to picture what the 
      offspring would look like here.
Mike: I'd be more concerned with what kind of parent lets
      both of their ankles get pregnant.

>     Sara was the admiral's first pregnancy, and she hadn't 
>been an easy one.  Even now, two months later, the painful 
>reminders of her condition were still evident.

Crow: Yeah, like that baby that seemed to hanging around
      the house.

>                                                Part of it 
>she blamed on the Romulans 

Mike: Whoa! Does Jay know about this?

>                           for the war;

Mike: Ah. Never mind.

>                                        throughout her 
>term, she had been in near-constant action.  She hadn't 
>slept regularly, but that was hardly a new thing for her.  

 Tom: Sleep was something Marrissa just recently heard of.
Crow: Is the author saying Marrissa's a tramp?
Mike: Um... it does kind of look that way...

>She considered that she might just be a little out-of-
>shape, but dismissed the idea,

Mike: For she was the all-powerful Marrissa, and such
      things did not happen to her!


>                               thinking of how often she'd 
>had to run up to the bridge, for some routine emergency.

 Tom: [basso] Oh yeah, well I ran to and from school every
      day. An hour run each day! Am I in shape? Heck no.

>     She supported herself on the desk, thankful for the
>weight-training she had done since the Klingon  
>negotiations.

Crow: Yeah, our hero, ladies and gentlemen...

>               She moved, at a snail's pace, hand-by-hand, 
>to the edge where her bags were waiting.  Resting for 
>barely a minute, she pushed herself into a standing 
>position before tapping her communicator and calling for
>beam-up.
>     The world around her sparkled;

 Tom: For once it didn't revolve.

>                                    then the dark green and 
>wood tones gave way to the more familiar beige and greys, 
>black panels and a variety of colors in the lights.  

Crow: That's not a beam-up, that's an LSD trip!

>Easing, she almost sighed.  Instead, she took a step 
>forward, and nearly crashed.

Mike: [Marrissa] Oh, hi everybody! I'm taking control 
      of this - woah, nap time!
 Tom: And she had the munchies something fierce!

>     Patterson Supra, the transporter chief, and one of 
>Marrissa's longest-time friends, rushed up to help her. 

Crow: [Supra, Igor-esque] Master! Wait for Supra!
 
>How long had he been stuck down here?

 Tom: [Marrissa] Oh, I forgot to unchain him...

>                                       She wondered 
>dizzily.  The thought vanished, fleetingly, as her vision 
>clouded.

Mike: Well, you can't say Marrissa's ambitions were a 
      little cloudy.

>          She felt the transporter dias beneath her again, 
>and the room blurred.
>

Mike: Whoo-hoo!
Crow: [Marrissa, southern accent] I LOOOOOOOVE this place!
 Tom: Let's fade out of here too.
[Mike lifts Tom up and the trio exits the theater.]

[1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 6 . . . ]

[The Bridge]
[The Bridge seems to be empty, although the surface of
 the console is covered with office supplies. After a 
 few moments, Mike pops out from behind from behind
 the council and pounces on a stapler sitting on the
 console.]
Mike: AH-HA!
[After a moment, Mike stands upright.]
Mike: Shoot.
[He looks around for a moment, then begins sneaking
 up on the lights to Castle Forrester. He then grabs
 them, shouting. The bots enter as he does this.]
Mike: GOTCHA! [beat] No, I guess that wasn't him either.
Crow: Having fun, Mike?
Mike: No, not really.
 Tom: What exactly *are* you doing?
Mike: [sighing] I think Odo's loose on the Bridge and
      I'm trying to track him down.
Crow: And you think he's here because...?  
Mike: It was all that he was doing in that last
      chapter.
 Tom: Makes sense to me.
Crow: Me too. How can we help?
Mike: Just start grabbing items until one of them
      turns into Odo. [Mike pounces on a pen.]
      AH-HA! [beat] Blast.
Crow: I don't know. That seems like we'd be 
      terrorizing helpless little staplers and
      pencil sharpeners.
 Tom: How did they find those guys on the show?
Mike: Blood tests, I think.
Crow: You sadist! You're not sticking anything
      into my little friends here. [cooing]
      It's okay, Mr. Liquid Paper. That meanie's
      not going to hurt you...
 Tom: Anything else?
Mike: They used some sort of weird light too.
 Tom: I've got a black light on me. 
Mike: Really? Why?
 Tom: I was thinking about going to a rave later.
Mike: Oh. Well, let's give it a go.
 Tom: Will do.
[The lights go out and the bridge is light by
 the black light, causing everything to look
 all freaky and psychedelic. After a moment
 the lighting returns to normal.]
 Tom: Looks like that didn't work either.
Mike: Where exactly is that black light?
 Tom: I had it installed in my dome. I've
      got a strobe in there too. Wanna see it?
Mike: Maybe later. Well, I guess I was wrong.
      And I was sure that...
Crow: Did the scary light scare you, little
      paper clip dispenser? That's okay.
      The mean man won't hurt you anymore...
[Tom and Mike look at each other for a moment,
 nod, then lunge and tackle Crow, dragging him
 behind the console. Sounds of a scuffle can be
 heard as the dialogue continues.]
Crow: [O.S.] Ow! Cut it out!
 Tom: [O.S.] Not until you stop playing Dr. 
      Dolittle with the office supplies!
Crow: [O.S.] Never! Owwwww!!!!
Mike: [O.S.] Are you gonna stop?
Crow: [O.S.] No! Owww!!! Stop! Owww!!!!
      Okay, okay! I give! I give!
[The trio resurfaces, Crow seemingly in a 
 great deal of pain. As they reappear, the 
 Marrissa sign begins to flash.]
Crow: How were you even able to get me in 
      a wedgie?
Mike: Lots of practice. I'll tell you more 
      later though, 'cause right now WE'VE
      GOT MARRISSA SIGN!!!!
[Mike hits the button and the lights begin
 to flash. As the crew rushes around, Cambot
 focuses in on a coffee mug on the counter.]
 Mug: Ha! The buffoon thought he could detect
      me, the greatest shapeshifter in all of
      law enforcement! 
[Cambot pans toward the doors.]
 Mug: And I, hey! Wait! Where are you going?
      I command to focus on me! Come back
      here!

[The door sequence begins, despite the coffee
 mug's pleas.]

[6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . .]

[Mike and the bots enter and sit.]
Mike: Say, did you guys hear something as we left?
Crow: No.
 Tom: Me neither.
Mike: Must be my imagination.
Third Chair from the Left: Yep. You're imagining
      things.
Crow: See?

 Tom: 2000 Central.
Crow: 2230 in Newfoundland.

Crow: Looks like public opinion is NOT on Sisko's side.

      Ukraine.

>his crew and his friends, saying, "May the Prophets guide

 Tom: [Sisko] They'll be driving cabs on Risa, if you 
      need to get directions.

>better be the Emissary.

 Tom: [Kira] I'm betting on the Rhine, you?
Crow: [Bajoran Officer] Defiant, it's always a fast ship.
Mike: [Sisko] This is not a horse race, you two.

>                            Their escort, the starship 
>Nevada, entered sensor range.

Crow: Instantly, casinos popped up all over the Bajor
      system.

>                               Sisko pursed his lips.  If 
>they had waited another hour, the Nevada would have been

 Tom: Yeah! Um, what are talking about again?

>     One at a time, the departing ships jumped to warp.  
>O'Brien led the charge, followed by Kennison.

Mike: Sam Kennison?
Crow: I hate my ex-wife! Oh, oh, OH!

>clearly wrong.

 Tom: Someone must have put sugar in the intermix 
      ratio chamber.
Crow: Or someone put a banana up the Defiant's 
      tailpipe.

>                An explosion ripped out the starboard 
>nacelle, and the ship disappeared in the engulfing
>blast. Following closely behind, the Rio Grande tried to 
>tear away, but vanished into the fiery squall.
>     The crew stood, shocked.

 Tom: Oh, the humanity!
Mike: That's what happens when you make a hydrogen-filled 
      warp core.

Mike: Then they decided to scan where the ships blew up,
      and they found scads of survivors!

>scattered debris, organic compounds, and plasma waste.  

Crow: What you would get in scanning any Iraqi military 
      complex.

Crow: [Nevada Captain] I'm sorry. I dropped my pencil.

 Tom: Start with Dennis Hopper!
Mike: Or Tommy Lee Jones!
Crow: Or TV's Frank!

Crow: [Nevada captain] Hell, we won't even conduct an 
      investigation as per Starfleet protocol! Let the 
      resigned old fart do it himself!

 Tom: It's not over until Marrissa sings the achy 
      breaky song!

>     Odo, sitting quietly on the shelf, disguised as a 
>starship model, listened to everything.

Mike: See? I was right. Odo just sits around and 
      impersonate things all day.

>                                         It was strange, he

 Tom: I don't recall hearing 'there MUST be a bomb' 
      anywhere in that dialogue.

Mike: Commie spies might be all over the station by now!

>              But why would he resign over something like 
>this?  Starfleet had been everything to Sisko, ever since 
>he and the constable first met.  Even if he were being 
>promoted away, he should have enough authority to postpone 
>the transfer until things were cleared up!

 Tom: Unless this would turn out to be as long as the OJ 
      Simpson trial.

>     He watched as Kira and Sisko left the room, without a

>information he had gathered since things started to change.  

Crow: [Odo] Sisko got bald, the Dominion arrived, Jadzia 
      died, some really big war, some bigger war, some 
      girl with strawberry juice...

>Every computer terminal on the station was keyed to Ops; 

 Tom: They're having a LAN party.
Mike: Yeah. Sisko's really good at Starcraft.

>not even Quark would be able to access the main system 
>without someone reading the entire transmission.  The

>security hadn't even been this tight during the war.

 Tom: The Legion of Doom must be hacking into DS9's 
      database.

>     Then there was this mass emigration.

Mike: That was because of the potato famine.

>                                           For some reason, 
>Bajor wanted Starfleet as far away as possible.

 Tom: *That* was because of the short supply of deodorant.

>                                                 Ever since 
>the Dominion War, Bajor had been building up its own 
>planetary defense fleet, so that in the event that the 
>Cardassian Republic became hostile, they would have the

Crow: But for some reason, Starfleet didn't take them 
      seriously when they asked for a huge quantity of
      Huggies.

>                    But it was premature to send all of
>Starfleet away!

 Tom: Smooth transitions? Nuts to that! Bajor claims DS9 
      with or without the peace deal!

>     Lastly, the former senior staff was behaving very 
>oddly.

Crow: Last night, he caught some of them watching 
      *Lifetime*!

      bottles with his urine too...

 Tom: Well, the Defiant always left an extra key under

Crow: Nice going Odo. Now Sisko's office floor may have 
      a stain.

 Tom: [Odo] I can't believe Sisko's password is "peekaboo".
      I mean, what kind of idiot would come up with a 
      password like that?
Mike: Stop taunting the other show's fans, Tom.

 Tom: [Odo] Although why the password spelled out

      down at Bajor.

Crow: Then, the Lincoln Logs!

Mike: Dear diary, today the dreamiest Andorian asked me

      that blue, strapless number...

 Tom: [Computer] Or show your driver's license.

      access?

>                         He was an excellent shape-shifter, 

Mike: Can he do Martha Raye?

Crow: And a pop up ad appeared.

Crow: [O'Brien] It hurts the eyes and all, and I may not
      be able to read for an hour or so after, but I 
      don't want people peeking into my diary!

>     "Bah!"

 Tom: AIIEEEE!!! The Teletubbies are on the station!

Mike: A Pontiac Grand-Am? Here? On the Promenade?

 Tom: Them cattle rustlers are headin' into town!

Crow: [Odo] Do you always greet your visitors with a
      security detail?

>"Admiral!" Odo said, rising from the chair.  "I want some

 Tom: 1812! Gettysburg! Robert Heinlein! 4!

>     Sisko lowered his phaser, slightly.  "I'm not an

Mike: [Sisko] I'm Supreme Fleet Admiral now. They
      just promoted me a few minutes ago.

>                   And I can't give you what you want, 

Crow: But if you try sometime, you just might find
      you get what you need.

 Tom: I don't think he's in the position to threaten
      right now.

Mike: [Sisko] Iamabovethelaw!

>     Sisko nodded.  "I know how you feel.  If I were in the

 Tom: Except Odo'd be more gooey about it.

>But if I tell you what I know, you'll find yourself honor-
>bound to contact Starfleet."
>     "Only if it's in the name of justice!"  Odo spouted.  

Mike: So he's shifted into a whale now?

>"You know me, Sisko.  You were there -- I decided long ago 
>that justice comes before the law."

Crow: Odo is Steven Segal in Out for Justice II: The 
      Shapeshifter who Shagged Me!

>     "I know," Sisko said, lowly.  "And it's a matter of 
>law, and justice.  But I'm afraid you wouldn't see our -- 
>my -- side of things."

 Tom: [Sisko] Whoops! Just spilled out a plot point!

>     "Justice is justice!"

Mike: And we must zig for great justice!
 Tom: That hasn't gotten any funnier, Mike. 

>                           The constable defended.  "Sides

Mike: [Odo] Amnesty is futile!

 Tom: [Sisko] Very well. We're rigging next year's Oscars.
      [murmur] That'll teach them to snub "American 
      History X."

Crow: Yeah, why try to make a pile of goo understand?

 Tom: [Sisko] One, we've come to the conclusion that 
      we need more gorillas in our life. Two: does 
      this dress make me look fat?

Crow: [Odo] Sir, you have it on "flashlight" setting.

Crow: Ack! The other plot!
 Tom: Warn us when you do that!

Mike: [Johnson] If I kill 8 more goblins, I'll make 5th

Crow: Even in the 24th century, there's still no cure 
      for Evercrack addiction.

Mike: There's the word. Almost.

>     Johnson looked up.  "Admiral!  Lie down.

Crow: [Johnson] Now roll over! Sit up! Beg!

 Tom: [Marrissa] No! Must conquer galaxy! Don't want nap
      time!

>"How long have I been on board?"
>     The doctor rose, striding over to the bed.  He waved a

 Tom: [Johnson] Nope, no signs of intelligent life here...

>                            "Five more hours, at least.  
>Then we can talk . . ."
>     "_How_long_?"

 Tom: [Johnson] Five more hours. Geez, don't you ever
      listen?

>     He sighed.  "Seventeen hours, twenty-two minutes.  

Mike: And thirty-three seconds.

Crow: [Marrissa] And this has changed from my previous self
      in what manner?
 
>                  He held up a hypospary.

 Tom: Ah. An injectible candy.
Mike: That's hypospree, Tom.

Mike: [Marrissa] Sleep is a sign of mortality! I will not
      have that!

>     Johnson chuckled.  "So is burnout.  Let me give you

 Tom: Burnout? Is he putting her on a treadmill?

>     "No," Marrissa refused, "no more drugs.

Mike: [Marrissa] Well, perhaps some more crank...

 Tom: What's this? Our megalomaniacal heroine, trapped

      lullabies?
Crow: Could be worse, Johnson might sing "achy breaky".
[The 'bots snicker.]

[All cheer.]
 Tom: Hey, there may be hope for this after all!

 Tom: Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's 
      awful. 
Mike: Stop it.

Mike: Like that a lot of ships were warping?

 Tom: They're preparing to strike at the hated Spanish

Mike: Worse, a Backstreet Boys concert.

 Tom: [Sisko] They never let me in on their cool

Crow: [Sisko] We panic like idiots.

      your fashion sense.

Crow: [Kira] Yes, Prime Minister?
Mike: BBC Bajor is on the air.

 Tom: Remember that name, people. It may be the most

Mike: Why was she, a Starfleet Captain, getting requests?
      And for that "Lady Marmalade" song?

 Tom: The moons had big clock on them, you see.
Crow: Say, is anyone else wondering what happened to 
      Sara?
Mike: That's right! Marrissa thought about giving her 
      to Jay, but it never said she did ...
 Tom: The poor kid's probably still back on Romulus.
Crow: Poor kid, nothing. She's probably organized a Kids'
      Crew government by now.

Mike: It even comes with no air grates. Keeps shape
      shifters from spilling out, you know.
 
>His own security precautions were working against him, far 
>too well.  Not even the computer acknowledged his command

Crow: The computer doesn't love him anymore.
 Tom: [Odo] But honey! I need to break out! Honey!

>     The deputy on duty obstinately refused to let him out, 
>saying his orders came directly from Admiral Kira.

 Tom: Admiral? What, was she promoted sideways into a 
      different branch of the service?

>     Admiral!  Odo thought; how long have I been out?

Crow: Brendon Fraser is Odo in Blast from the Past II:
      Electric Boogaloo!

>     Within minutes, Sisko arrived.  The constable gave him 
>a weary, suspicious glare.  "You're not Admiral Sisko."

Mike: No. I'm Ed Koch. How am I doin'?

>     The bald man shrugged.  "You're absolutely right.  I'm 
>not Admiral Sisko.  As of 2500 hours two days ago, I no 
>longer hold any official, or unofficial, position in 
>Starfleet."

Crow: [Sisko] I've been downsized. [crying] Oh, Odo!
      I feel so betrayed! Hold me!

>     Odo grunted, disgustedly.  That wasn't what he meant.
>     Sisko knew it.  "I am Benjamin Sisko, and Doctor 
>Bashir can prove it.

Mike: [Sisko] I'm gonna have the dead man prove it.

>                      I'm not a Changeling, if that's what 
>you're worried about."
>     The shape-shifter gave him a long, sideways look.  

 Tom: [Odo] You're really winging this, aren't you?

>"Didn't Dr. Bashir leave the station with the rest of the 
>Starfleet population?"

Crow: [Sisko] Oh, right. Stupid me. Sorry. Guess I can't 
      prove myself now. Ah well, die anyways.

>     "Technically, yes.  Officially, yes."
>     "On the Defiant?"
>     "Yes."
>     "The same Defiant we watched explode?"
>     "Yes."
>     "And he's still here?"
>     "Yes."

Crow: Deep Space Nine is becoming almost Voyager-ish in 
      its plot inconsistencies.

>     Odo knew a long story when he heard one.  "Can I be 
>released, now?"

Mike: Being held against his will listening to a long 
      story... does this sound familiar, guys?
 Tom: Nope.
Crow: Not a bit.

>     Sisko shook his head.  "There are a few . . . 
>assurances we have to have, first."

 Tom: [Sisko] Remember that time someone smuggled those 
      50 barrels of butterscotch on board and poured it 
      all over your quarters without you knowing? Well,
      guess who? I must say that it was the slowest prank
      I ever made.

>                                     He began explaining 
>what most of the conspiracy around the station had been, 
>for the last few days.  Leaving out a handful of details, 
>he gave the constable enough of the story to ease his 
>suspicions.

Mike: Well, Sisko's become a James Bond villain.
 Tom: He'll be stroking a white Persian cat soon.

>     "I see," Odo finally said.  "If you had told me this 
>before the Defiant left, you thought I would sabotage the 
>plan, or contact Starfleet myself."

Crow: [Sisko] Well, you're just a tattletale, but that 
      explanation will do just nicely.

>     The former admiral nodded.
>     "Good thought.

 Tom: [Odo] But I'm still squealing, though.

>                     Grand theft of a starship -- a warship 
>-- especially one with a cloaking device, would catch 
>Starfleet's attention.  What do you need them for?"

Mike: [Sisko] I'm going to head back in time to destroy 
      Starfleet. And I'm going to wear a Spock tie while
      I do it.

>     Sisko paused.  "I don't know, actually.

 Tom: Geez. At least Son of Sam had a talking dog to
      justify his actions.

>                                              But I have to 
>have the Defiant.

Crow: [Sisko] It's mine! It's got my diary in there and 
      everything!

>                   The Rio Grande was incidental -- for old 
>times' sake.  She's been with us from the start.

Mike: [Sisko] Plus, she's paid for!

>                                                  At this 
>point, it doesn't matter.  Once the holographic fireball 
>took over, the cloak engaged; the Rio Grande and Defiant 
>were safely cloaked, and effectively derelict spacecraft,
>open for salvage rights.

Crow: Good grief.
Mike: Who's giving Sisko legal advice? Blackbeard?

>                          My crew salvaged, not stole, 
>them."

 Tom: I'm sure a grave robber can say the same thing about 
      dead corpses.

>     Odo rolled his eyes.  "And, because that kind of fraud 
>is *very* illegal, you knew you couldn't tell me."
>     "Justice or not, your duty was clear."
>     "Please.  How was justice a factor?"

Crow: This from someone who earlier made a big deal about
      justice.

>     Sisko explained that the crew who opposed Starfleet 
>policy needed protection,

 Tom: Well sure, since they're criminals now!

>                          that Starfleet was losing sight 
>of itself,

Crow: It was getting so fat that it couldn't see its own
      feet!

>           and that sometimes, even the good guys can be 
>wrong.
>     The constable nodded.  "You were right about me.  I 
>would have followed protocol.  Justice and justifiable are 
>not the same thing.  *Now* can I come out?"

Mike: Ick. I just pictured Odo's belly button beginning 
      to sing.

>     "Alright.  But under two conditions.  One, you will 
>not have communications access outside of the station, for 
>now.  Two,

 Tom: [Sisko] You morph into a bunny. I just love that 
      trick!

>            until the Bajoran Council of Ministers reaches 
>its verdict, you will not be chief of security."

Crow: [Aussie] Three: No poofters!

>     If Odo were human, he would have swallowed.  

Mike: Instead, he just flooped and hopped around, shaking
      his wadoozle.

>Reluctantly, he agreed to the terms.
>

 Tom: But he added in a rider that he'd get a half mil
      if they made the playoffs.

>     "You kept pretty close tabs on them, then, Chief?"  
>Marrissa asked, feeling agitated.

Crow: [Odo] Well, they were out of Pepsi One.

>     O'Brien nodded.  "The flight recorder has the whole 
>account.  I went over it a dozen times since we came here.  
>It's just like my monitor showed -- they were gone in less 
>than thirty seconds."

 Tom: And he watched it over and over again? Wouldn't it
      be as slow as watching the Guardian Force animations
      in Final Fantasy VIII?

>                       He turned his face to the floor.  
>"We lost a lot of good people.  Friends."

Mike: Matt, David, Jennifer, Courtney, the other Matt, Lisa.
      All of them, dead!

>     Picard felt sympathy for him.  Still, some part of the 
>back of her mind was trying to remind her that this man had 
>once infiltrated the Orion Syndicate; he was obviously a 
>very talented actor.

Crow: Um...
Mike: Let's let this insight into the author's psyche slide.
 Tom: Hey! He was really good in The Commitments!

>     "Chief.  You're retiring next week, right?"

Crow: And if I know my TV show cliches, then he'll be 
      dying in the next few minutes.

>     He looked up, slightly confused.  "Right," he said, 
>"this Wednesday."

Mike: The day after the tractor beams are installed.

>     Marrissa nodded, standing.  Her ankles began to ache 
>again, and it was driving her crazy.

 Tom: Boy, Marrissa has some weird turn-ons.
Crow: [Marrissa] Hold still for a moment. Maybe if I kick
      you it'll snap back into place.

>                                      "What do you plan to 
>do, after you've left Starfleet?  After all, your wife is 
>one of the most respected botanists in the quadrant.  You 
>yourself have been in the fleet for most of your life.  
>What will you do, when the adventure ends?"

Crow: Start a new campaign?

>     O'Brien looked at her.  "Admiral Sisko taught us; it 
>never ends.

Mike: [O'Brien] They just write books, and occasionally
      they make a movie about us.

>             As to what I'll do . . . I hadn't really 
>thought about it.  Settle down on some nice planet, maybe?  

 Tom: [O'Brien] I heard Venus is nice this time of year,
      even if it is covered in deadly gases.

>Go back to Earth, get reacquainted with my roots . . .

Crow: Hey, maybe Geordi can help you with that one.

>                                                       I 
>really hadn't thought about it."
>     "Maybe come back to Bajor?"

Mike: A land of warm, sunny tropical beaches and 
      unparalleled luxury. Yes, come back to Bajor!

>     Just for an instant, his eyes flickered something.

 Tom: He's sending an SOS out to Sisko. His cover's blown!
Mike: Or maybe he just fidgeted...
 Tom: Not a chance!

>                                                         "I 
>. . . I might, now that you mention it.  Hadn't really 
>thought about it, you know . . ."

Crow: [O'Brien] Some guest shots, I guess. Maybe I'll
      direct an episode or two...

>     She pursed her lips.  He had repeated himself three 
>times.

 Tom: And now Candyman was standing around in the background
      looking for a cheese danish.

>        He was faltering on something she was onto.  "Oh, 
>come on, Chief, I know you better than that.  You always 
>have a plan.

Crow: [Marrissa] Not very good ones, but plans nonetheless.

>              Especially when your career is winding down, 
>there's less and less for you to do, you need to keep your 
>mind active.  Surely you had some goal you wanted to
>accomplish after the uniform comes off!"

Mike: HBO presents O'Brien After Dark.

>     O'Brien flushed.

 Tom: He must be interviewing Jennifer Tilley. She can 
      get quite randy...

>                       "Well, now that you mention it," he 
>said, leaning closer, "I've always wanted to kayak the 
>Moyin Rapids on Bajor -- but please, don't tell Keiko; 
>she'd kill me!"

 Tom: [O'Brien] She forbids me to do anything that's 
      considered cardiovascular. She thinks I'll have a 
      heart attack or something.

>     Oh.  So he *was* planning to come back, but not for . 
>. . that's why he hesitated.

 Tom: Oh please, because his wife doesn't want him kayaking?
Crow: [O'Brien] Oh, and I was planning to take up skydiving,
      but don't tell her that either.

>                              She leaned herself heavily on 
>the table, trying to alleviate some of the swelling on her 
>ankles.

Crow: Couldn't she just use some Dr. Scholl's for that?

>         Kennison's interview hadn't revealed anything, and 
>it seemed that this one wouldn't either.  It was giving her 
>a tremendous headache.

Mike: Gee, a headache, ankle pain, fainting, unable to 
      sleep... Marrissa's gonna be one walking ice pack
      after this one.
 Tom: Better place her on the DL list.

>                        A hand caught her arm and shoulder 
>-- O'Brien had a worried expression on his face, as he 
>helped her back into her chair.
>     "Are you all right, Ma'am?"  He asked, genuinely 
>concerned.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Oh, nothing. Just a lot of pain, comes
      with the job and the ultimate power, you know.

>     She nodded, waving him back, slightly.

Crow: The author seems to like the word 'slightly'.
 Tom: And so Marrissa slightly sighed as she slightly sat 
      down on the slightly tilted chair...

>                                             "Did you see 
>anything odd going on, while you were at the station?"

Crow: Well, that Old Navy woman kept showing up to talk 
      about turtlenecks...

>                                                        She 
>tried to continue her questioning.

Mike: [O'Brien] Well, there were plenty of dartboards with
      your picture on them, but I swear most of the darts 
      usually missed. Honest!

>     "Well, now that you mention it," the commander said, 
>thinking, "the Dabo wheel was a bit sticky.  I don't think 
>anyone won a game the entire time I was there . . ."

 Tom: [O'Brien] Not that I mind winning a whole lot of 
      money betting against them.

>     "Chief!"  Picard said, sharply.  "Romulans.  Spies.  
>Mad bombers

Bots: Romulans and bombers and spies, oh my! Romulans 
      and bombers and spies, oh my!

>            -- was anyone acting strangely?  Admiral 
>Sisko?"

Mike: [Marrissa] Was he pretending to be that 1950s
      writer again?

>     "Oh," he considered for a moment.  "The admiral was 
>just glad to see us all again.  Well, most of us.

 Tom: [O'Brien] He called Quark a dickweed but I think 
      it was sour grapes over that Dabo game.

>                                                   Worf's 
>off by the Klingon border, ferrying supplies and wounded.

Crow: [O'Brien] The Klingons say that the wounded make 
      good photon torpedo casings!
  
>Last time I talked with him, I'll just say, he wasn't 
>terribly happy!"  He chuckled, thinking of the Klingon 
>wishing for battle, while surrounded by liters of Romulan
>Ale.

Mike: Commander Worf. Klingon Prohibitionist.

>      "And acting strangely?  No, I think all of our 
>Romulans, spies, and mad bombers were acting pretty 
>normal."

 Tom: [O'Brien] For people who were trying to kill us, 
      spy on us, and blow us into teeny little pieces, 
      they were pretty normal.

>     Marrissa gave him a tired look.  "You're awfully 
>jovial for someone who just lost a number of friends."

Crow: [O'Brien] Mommy always told me to be light-hearted 
      and annoying, no matter how depressing the
      situation is.

>     O'Brien raised his eyebrows, and he leaned back, 
>slightly.

Crow: There's "slightly" again.
 Tom: And Mr. O'Brien slightly frowned at slightly 
      tired Marrissa, slightly annoyed that she is slightly
      persisting in this interrogation.

>          "Where d' you suppose the term 'Irish Wake' comes 
>from?"

Crow: Scotland? Les Miserables? Three's Company? We don't
      know!

>        To her unfaltering gaze, he sighed.  "Sorry.  I 
>just never believed it was  a good idea to temper bad 
>events with bad feelings.  Making light of a dark 
>situation, you know?"

Mike: [O'Brien] That's why nobody ever asks me to do 
      their eulogy or come to the funeral.

>     She barely heard him.

 Tom: Well, she is standing under the cone of silence.

>                            This had to be a migraine, she 
>thought, feeling like her head was bursting.

Crow: Oh, she's just being scanned. 

>                                              She closed 
>her eyes.  "That will be all, Chief."
>     As he passed her on his way out, he stopped.  

Mike: [O'Brien] Is she having a migraine? Nah, must be me.

>"Admiral, would you like some help to Sickbay?  I . . ."  
>She didn't even acknowledge him.  Both elbows were propped 
>on the table, and her face was being held up by her hands.  
>Every breath came out ragged.  Every ounce of her was
>fighting this pain, trying to force it back into the 
>recesses of her mind.
>

Crow: Wow! These 24th century brain freezes are really 
      powerful!
Mike: [Marrissa] Shouldn't have had that last Slush Puppy!

>     Kira stood in the airlock,

Crow: [Kira] Hmm. Sisko told me to come out here and look
      for Santa and those two kids. I wonder where they
      are?

>                                staring out into space.  
>Dark and speckled, it didn't hold the same wonder for her 
>as it used to.

 Tom: Before it was nice and bright and had pretty bands 
      of light.

>                When she was little -- before she joined 
>Shakaar's resistance cell, before she started fighting 
>Cardassians -- she remembered looking into the
>sky, and wondering what it was, all those millions of 
>little dots.

Crow: Didn't your mommy tell you? It's someone's Starbrite!

>             She imagined they were the Prophets, smiling 
>at her.

 Tom: They had great teeth. Must be Colgate.

>         When she was old enough to understand Cardassians, 
>though, it changed.  The sky was a place of evil, hatred, 
>where the scaly monsters came from.

Mike: Either that or the Cardassians were the Prophets' 
      tooth decay.

>                                     And when they were 
>finally gone, the sky was a place of redemption; especially
>so after the Emissary -- Sisko -- had come.  Redemption, 
>hope, and wonder.  

Crow: [Kira] The sky can be such a hypocrite. One minute 
      they're the harbingers of doom, the next they're the 
      good Samaritan.

>     She took a deep breath.  Not anymore.

Mike: [Kira] Now they're just a bunch of gases. And I 
      thought Quark had a lot of hot air.

>                                            Now, Bajor 
>stood alone against a galaxy at war.

Crow: Ah. They're space Canadians.

>                                      They had been there 
>before, right before the Cardassian occupation.  Despite 
>Sisko's assurances that everything was for the best, she 
>felt . . . uncomfortable.

 Tom: Maybe that Bolian tea was too strong for you, Kira. 
      You know you shouldn't have caffeine before bed time.

>     The door rolled back, exposing the night sky to her, 
>directly.


Crow: [Kira] Wait a minute, I can't bre - oof!

>          If she wanted, it seemed like she could simply 
>step off into infinity.  As a matter of reflex, she stepped 
>back.
>     Light burst into the airlock as a door opened out of 
>nowhere.

Mike: Hey! It's a Sliders crossover!

>          Kira squinted, her brain sorting through the 
>mixed signals it was receiving.

Crow: [Kira] Is Darth Vader coming from that door? Or do
      I go into the light?

>                                 A silhouetted figure 
>stepped forward.

Crow: Oh, it's just Joel... Joel?
Bots: Joel!
Mike: It's not Joel, guys.
Crow: Sorry, had a little flashback.

>                  Admiral Kira stepped back again, allowing 
>him aboard the station.

Mike: [Kira] Oh, hello invading stranger. Are you here for 
      conquest or destruction?
 Tom: [basso] Destruction.
Mike: [Kira] Good choice, this way to Ops.

>     "Well," Doctor Bashir remarked dryly, "remind me to 
>demand a raise for Miles."

Mike: [Kira] Honey! Oops, I just broke character.

>     Dax followed closely behind, along with a number of 
>crewmembers,

Crow: Groupies.

>             all the defectors who had been recorded as 
>lost when the Defiant apparently exploded.  The ship sat 
>cloaked just outside, invisible to those on the station, or 
>any passing ships.

 Tom: I wonder what happens when a passing ship decides to
      dock there.
Mike: [Ensign on passing ship] Sir, there's a door opening 
      in mid-space and some people are coming out. Shall       
      I shoot them?

>     "Sorry we're late," Nog said.  "It was more difficult 
>getting the Rio Grande back to the landing pad than we 
>thought.

Crow: [Nog] We forgot where we last put the door opener.

>          I hope you didn't have to wait long, General."
>     "Admiral," Kira corrected him.
>     "Oh, no ma'am, I'm a captain!" He said, 
>misinterpreting her.  He pointed to his rank insignia.  
>"Not that it matters much, anymore."

 Tom: [Nog] Pretty much everyone's in the Starfleet brass,
      now.

>     She decided it wasn't really worth explaining, right 
>now.  The crew had to all come aboard before -- well, 
>before whatever Sisko was expecting to have happen.

Crow: Before 'Temptation Planet' comes on.

>                                                     These 
>were people trained to operate the station in a crisis,

 Tom: They were not trained, however, to operate during 
      peacetime.

>                                                        and 
>from the sound of it, crisis control would be absolutely 
>necessary.

Mike: They found out that Britney Spears was coming.

>     "I'm going to *what*?!"

Crow: Zha'ha'dum. Is that a problem?

>     Picard looked sternly at his adoptive daughter. 

 Tom: [Jean-Luc] Don't be a chicken. Bawk-bawk-bawkah!!
 
>"Starfleet hasn't been able to contact the Council of 
>Ministers in weeks,

Crow: [Picard] Their line's been busy the whole time. We
      think they're online playing Quake.

>all Starfleet personnel from the station.  Intelligence 
>reports that this could be a new policy of Bajoran

 Tom: [Jean-Luc] Either that or they just don't like us
      anymore. Those Bajorans can be so touchy.

>               As a Federated planet, isolationism would
>undermine the network of trust we have with all our member 
>worlds.

Crow: [Jean-Luc] This is pretty much the idea. We trust 
      that they won't attack us, and they trust that we 
      don't turn them into the next asteroid belt.

>         Also, if they become defensive of their territory, 
>we lose access to the Gamma Quadrant through the wormhole.  
>I don't have to tell you how unacceptable that is."

 Tom: They'd have to have millions of floating orange space
      cones!

>     "Dad," Marrissa groaned.

Crow: [Marrissa] Are you telling me to dictate some foreign
      planet's policy? Again?

>                               Not because she wanted to

Mike: [Marrissa] Waitaminute! You can do that? Damn!

Crow: Remember to give it its bottle of iron.

      suppressants?

Mike: The Cardassians couldn't stop her.
Crow: The Trakce couldn't stop her.
 Tom: The Romulans couldn't stop her.
Mike: Nor could the Dominion.
Crow: Or the Borg.
 Tom: But form XY-41/A? It's Marrissa's doom.

Mike: [Jean-Luc] Not that I should've done that long ago

 Tom: [Marrissa] Diplomacy bites, anyhow. Too slow and

      escaping are approximately three thousand, seven
      hundred and twenty to one.

 Tom: [Sisko] If this screws up, I'm converting religions

Mike: Someone torpedoed the sucker. Probably Merten or
      Schepke.

Crow: Hey!
 Tom: Sisko must have read those stories too!
Mike: It's probably what sent him over the edge.
 All: [whispering] Join us! Join us!

 Tom: [Marrissa] To protect the world from devastation.
      To unite all...
Mike: [Jay] M? Wrong speech.

 Tom: [Marrissa] No, I won't. Fire, Ensign.

>will be added to your own.  Resistance is futile."

 Tom: Zing! Point to Sisko!
Mike: Sisko's even skipped ahead to read "Hail to the Queen"!
Crow: I'm impressed!

>     Dax looked up, startled and slightly amused.  That was 
>out of character for Sisko . . .

Crow: Maybe he's channeling one of us.
[pause]
 All: Naaaah.
 Tom: BTW, Keeler? When your own characters start questioning 
      their characterization, you might be doing something 
      wrong.

>     Picard was caught off-guard.  The adrenaline rush she 
>hoped for finally arrived, and calm settled on her.  

 Tom: [Marrissa] Oh yeah, that's the stuff! Don't ever leave
      me, bloodlust!

>Muscles quieted their cacophony.  She replied, "Benjamin 
>Sisko.  I wondered how long it would take for you to

Crow: [Sisko] A couple of years in a long-running science-
      fiction show can do that to you.
 Tom: We should know.

>     "Not as long as you'd think," he replied evenly.  
>"What would you like, Admiral?"


 Tom: [Marrissa] Well, I would like a Harry Potter novel.
      Of course, you heard of the big craze going on with 
      these books. I never knew WHY those books are popular,
      but anyway... oh, how about another horse? You can 
      never have too many of them. They're so strong and 
      fast and I can win plenty of latinum just by putting 
      all my horses on one track, betting on the one with
      the biggest odds, and then purposely letting that one 
      win. Of course, that's considered fraud, but I 
      have diplomatic immunity because I'm a princess, 
      you know...

>     "Well, some answers would be nice.

Mike: [Marrissa] But not the truth, 'cause apparently
      I can't handle the truth.

>                                         And maybe the

 Tom: How can you get a court-martial if you already quit?

Crow: [Sisko] Should I get you a date with Marky Mark too?

>     The admiral rolled her eyes, thinking, he should get

>accept is three."

Crow: Three what?
Mike: Are they even negotiating for the same thing?
 Tom: She wants all three doors instead of just door number one.

>     Sisko's voice floated tauntingly across the channel.  
>"That's too bad, Admiral.  I can only offer you one."
>     Who the hell did he think he was?

Mike: He's that high-falooting Emissary, that's who.

>                                        "Benjamin, I don't

Mike: It's Marrissa after Dark. This Thursday on ASC.

[The crew stand and exit the theater.]

[1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 6 . . .]

[The Bridge of the SoL]

[As the doors open, Tom and Crow are writing in
 a large tome.]

Crow: Okay, how about Carson Daly?
 Tom: Nah. He's annoying but not that annoying.
      The Baja Men?
Crow: By the time we get back, their fifteen
      minutes will be already over. How 
      about Tom Green?
 Tom: Sure, if Drew hasn't gotten to him
      first.
[Mike enters and walks over to the bots.]
Mike: Hey guys? What'cha doin?
Crow: We're just updating our list.
Mike: Your list?
 Tom: Years ago...
Crow: I think we were suffering through 
      "Time of the Apes" at the time.
 Tom: ...Crow and I decided to create a list 
      of people whom, if we ever get back
      to earth, we'd take revenge on.
Mike: Oh. Well, what if you end up in an
      efficiency apartment in Minnesota?
Crow: [snort] Yeah, like that'll happen.
 Tom: Get real, Mike. You wanna hear it?
Mike: I've got nothing better to do, so
      sure.
Crow: Well, we started off with some easy
      ones. Coleman Francis. Ed Wood. Tor
      Johnson...
Mike: Aren't they dead?
 Tom: Yeah, but that's not going to stop
      us. 
Crow: Then we moved onto some fanfic authors.
      Stephen Ratliff. Jim Theis. Stephen 
      Ratliff. Doc Thinker. Stephen Ratliff...
Mike: Okay, I get the picture.
 Tom: Then we started free associating. We'd
      find Dan Cortez, that Aflac Duck, those
      Whazzup guys, [mumble] you, [normal]
      Jar Jar Binks...
Mike: Excuse me? 
 Tom: Jar Jar. You know? From Phantom...
Mike: No, the one before that one.
Crow: The Whazzup guys?
[Mike glares at the bots.]
 Tom: Oh. Um, you.
Crow: You annoy us sometimes, Mike.
Mike: Like when?
Crow: For example...
[As Crow begins to speak, the satellite is
 buffeted by explosions. Gypsy rushes in, from
 stage left.]
Gypsy: Mike! We're under attack! 
 Tom: Duh, Gypsy!
Gypsy: And something's coming in on the
       hexfield too! Did you know that,
       smartie?
 Tom: No.
Gypsy: Of course not, After all, you and 
       Crow never pay attention to anything
       I say until there's something attacking
       us!  Why, if I had to count how many
       times I've had to rush in here shouting
       about how something is attacking...
Mike: Gypsy! Will you just open the hexfield?
Gypsy: Huh? Oh. Sure, Mike.
[The hexfield opens, to reveal... a baby
 dressed in a Starfleet uniform and sitting in
 a command chair. Mike and the bots stare at
 the tyke.]

Baby: [gurgles]
[A bespectled man, (Paul Chaplin) also in a 
 Starfleet uniform, leans into the hexfield's
 view.]
Officer: Surrender now, or face the wrath of 
         Grand Admiral Sara Alara Picard,
         head of the Star Fleet Babies' Crew!

[The quartet stands motionless for a moment,
 then collectively begin laughing.]
 
Mike: Oh, this is rich.
Crow: This is too much, even for Ratliff.
 Tom: Oh, are we supposed to be afraid of the
      wittle baby?

[The ship is buffeted again by explosions.]

Officer: The Grand Admiral *is* in command 
       of a fully armed Annihilator Class 
       Starship.

 Tom: Oh. I guess we should be afraid then.

Sara: [gurgle]
Officer: You have insulted the Grand Admiral's
      mother undeservedly and her father, er,
      less undeservedly, And for that you
      must be punished!
Sara: [gurgle] 
Officer: Right after we feed the Grand 
      Admiral.

[The officer takes a bottle and begins to feed
 Sara. Cambot pans in on Mike and the bots.]
Crow: Does anyone have a way out of this?
 Tom: I say we retaliate with every weapon
      we have onboard! We'll blow them out
      of the stars!
Gypsy: We're unarmed, doofus.
 Tom: Can we shout at them then?
Mike: I've got a plan.
Gypsy: Sound doesn't travel in space.
 Tom: Well...
Gypsy: You know, I could scoot over there and
       disable all of their weapons. That is
       I could if I wasn't tethered to this
       stinking satellite.
Mike: I've got a plan.
Crow: Maybe if we cry a lot, she'll spare
      us.
Mike: Hey! I have a plan!
 Tom: Mike, we can't blow up another planet.
Mike: Relax, just follow my lead.

[Cambot pans out. In the hexfield, Sara is
 being burped.]

Sara: [Burp]

[See? Anyway, the officer places Sara back in
 the chair and then turns to the screen.]

Officer: Now that Elite Grand Admiral Picard
      is fed, our vengeance can begin. Any
      last words?

Mike: A couple. o/~ You can tell the world
      you never was my girl. You can burn 
      my clothes when I'm gone. o/~

Officer: What are you doing? 
[He turns towards Sara, who is yawning.]

Mike: o/~ Or tell can tell your friends just
      what a fool I've been. And laugh and joke
      about me on the phone. o/~

Officer: No! You can't!
[The bots shrug and join in.]
 
 All: o/~ But don't tell my heart. My achy-breaky
      heart. I just don't think it'd understand.
      And if you tell my heart. My achy-breaky 
      heart, it might blow up and kill this man.
      Ooh! o/~

[Back on the bridge, Sarah's eyes are closed
 and she's snoring softly.]
Officer: [softly] Oh, fine. The All-Powerful
      Elite Grand Admiral is asleep now. But
      she will get her vengeance, mark my
      words! Just right after naptime...
[The hexfield closes and Cambot pans
 back over to Mike and the bots.]
Crow: Wow! You actually did have a plan!
Mike: Yep.
 Tom: But what happens after naptime's over?
[The fanfic sign begins to flash.]
Mike: Don't worry about it. I've got a 
      "Blue's Clues" tape around here. But
      right now WE'VE GOT MARRISSA SIGN!!!

[Mike hits the lights and the door sequence begins.]

[6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . .]

[The trio files in and takes their seats.]
Crow: Er, Mike?
Mike: Yeah?
Crow: Don't think that I'm unhappy with you
      saving our lives and all, but why exactly
      do you have a "Blue's Clues" tape?
Mike: The NWO uses them to convey secret messages.
      That Steve's a long-time CFR member.
Crow: Oh.
Mike: Plus I think that singing salt shaker is
      kinda neat.

 Tom: And special thanks to TBS for "Time Extended"...

Mike: Part of the "Marrissa goes nuts" trilogy.

>     A volley spattered across the defensive screens, but 
>didn't penetrate.

Mike: [Marrissa] Arm paintball torpedoes! I wanna see 
      what happens when I shoot these!

>                   The station's weapons turrets began 
>cycling visibly on the viewscreen.

 Tom: How are those bicycles working in zero-gravity?

>     Seeing his wife debating whether or not she could 
>stand, Jay took some initiative, surprising everyone. 
 
Mike: Including us!
 Tom: Spineless Boy is actually doing something!

>Since Sara's birth, he had been a more commanding force, 
>compensating for Marrissa's condition.  Not that she 
>minded, but it was unsettling for her to be in less than
>complete control.

 Tom: It felt... unnatural.
 
>                  Jay rose from his seat, focusing on the 
>viewscreen.

Mike: [Jay] Hey! Turn it back! "The Amazing Race" is on!

>     "Evasive maneuvers!"

[Mike buries his head in his hands.]
 Tom: Never mind. 
Crow: Jay's 0 for 47 now.

>     Well, Shayna thought, biting her lip, he gets an "A" 
>for effort, anyway.

Crow: Oh great! Shayna's trying to steal our gig now!
Mike: [mumbling] She can have it.

>                     It reminded her somewhat of the late 
>Admiral Riker, back on the Enterprise-D when he was a 
>commander; he usually served the same function Jay was, 
>now.

 Tom: He made a good target, just in case bad guys made
      it to the bridge.
Crow: Plus, he makes Marrissa look good in comparison.

>     Picard herself might have caught a nostalgic grin, if 
>she hadn't felt so tense and angry.  As it was, she lashed 
>out at her husband.

Crow: Marrissa Picard for Maybelline.

>                     "Thank-you, Jay.  Can we be a little 
>more specific?"

Mike: [Marrissa] Unless your idea was to plot a course
      right into the planet's core.

>     He turned red.

 Tom: Jay, buddy, we feel for you.

>                     "Evasive pattern Picard-Delta-four-
>one-oh!"

Crow: One of Tommy Tutone's lesser hits.

>     "Four-oh-one."  She corrected him.
>     "Four-oh-one!"  He sat back down.

Mike: That's our Jay.
 Tom: [Marrissa] Jay, now you're sitting on my lap.
Crow: [Jay] Sorry, Ma'am.

>     The young girl at helm implemented the course, 
>swinging the Enterprise in a tight arc across the line of 
>sight for the station's targeting sensors.

 Tom: Last time I remember, when you evade, you're 
      supposedly to get AWAY from the line of sight.

>                                            Phaser blasts 
>lashed out furiously, following the starship's trail 
>across, until they began striking their own station.
>

Crow: [Sisko] Oops! Sorry, should've aimed at the ship.

>     Odo watched the battle unfolding outside his window.  

 Tom: [Odo] Hmm, am I supposed to panic or something at this?
Mike: Tonight on Fox: When Origami Starships Attack!

>He paced the room, reaching out to touch the door, and 
>meeting only a forcefield.

Crow: Aw, that's sad--his advances so coldly rejected ...

>                            He jerked his hand back.  
>Without the forcefields, he could easily escape; but where 
>would he go?

Crow: Cabo's nice this time of year.
Mike: Nah. Someone might accidentally drink him when 
      he's sleeping.
Crow: Yeah. They'll drink anything there.

>              The station was completely sealed within the 
>shields, and he had no communications access code.  He 
>turned himself into a chair to sit.

 Tom: He later got bored and turned into a rocking chair
      to rock.
Crow: Bending his knees just wasn't good enough for the 
      high and mighty shapeshifter, was it?
Mike: Well, it's text, so the special effects budget is
      virtually unlimited.

>                                     The floor trembled, 
>and he nearly fell over.
>

 Tom: You mean tipped over, didn't you?

>     "Report!"

Mike: [Syral] We're dogmeat, sir.

>               Sisko yelled, catching himself at the 
>railing.  Sparks exploded behind him, making the overhead 
>lights seem dim by comparison.

Crow: You think by now Starfleet would have the technology
      to stop those sparks.
[Tom snickers.]

>                                Consoles flickered as the 
>crew tried to reroute.

Crow: And I-25 became backed up from the overflow.

>     Dax clambered with the sensor array.  "Targeting 
>sensors followed the Enterprise at close range -- she 
>fooled them into thinking upper docking pylon three was a 
>target!"

Mike: [Syral] She put a big Barney suit on top of the pylon
      and the sensors reacted instantly!

>     "Picard-Delta-four-oh-one."  Sisko nodded, 
>appreciatively.

 Tom: [Sisko] The Fratricide manuever.

>                Timing, speed, and range were everything.  

Crow: Except for location, of course.

>"Target phasers and quantum torpedoes manually.

Mike: [Syral] Shall I go bring up the Star Wars 
      interface, sir?

>                                                I don't 
>want to accidentally lose any more of the station!"  He 
>looked at the damage report.  A large gash had seared
>the pylon base.  If they had been in orbit of Bajor, it 
>probably would have ripped out entirely.

Crow: [Sisko] They dented my station! And I just got it
      turtle-waxed!

>                                          He swallowed.

Mike: Proving that he was indeed human.

>                                                         He 
>could almost feel his neutrinos spinning the wrong way.

Tom: Well, this is an interesting place for a lesson in
     Quantum Mechanics...

>     "She's continuing the attack!"  Kira called.

Crow: There's a revelation.

>                                                  "Shields 
>at ninety-two percent and falling.  The Enterprise is still 
>at optimal!"

Mike: Well, isn't that just Prime?

>     "Then let's even things out."

Crow: [Sisko] Call Marrissa and ask if she can lower the 
      shields just a bit.

>                                    Sisko growled, moving 
>quickly to the weapons control.  The Admiral slipped out of 
>his way.  "We have twenty times the firepower of even a 
>Nova-class starship.  Let's use it!"

 Tom: They do? 
Mike: Sure! Puff Daddy and his entourage are on board.
      They'll even things out.

>                                      His fingers danced 
>across the keypad, sighting the gargantuan ship as well as 
>he could.  He fired.
>

 Tom: YES!
Crow: Go, Sisko! Vaporize her!

>     This time, Marrissa didn't hesitate to stand.

 Tom: [Marrissa] It's a miracle! I can walk again!

>     Fifteen torpedoes flared directly toward them, making 
>it look as though space itself was tearing a path to hell.

 All: Oooh!
Crow: Nice imagery!
Mike: It's a shame we have to riff him mercilessly for it.
 Tom: Yep. So, space is paved with good intentions?
Mike: It might look like Bayonne.
Crow: I think that it looks like an existential freeway.

>     "Pattern -- UP!"  She shouted, dispensing with 
>tactics.

 Tom: Up? You mean there's more to space than just the 
      linear path?

>     Lynn, the conn officer, hesitated, then punched the 
>attitude and impulse controls.

Mike: Lynn didn't get a response, so she tried kicking it  
      instead.

>                                One after another, each 
>torpedo rocked them.

 Tom: [Marrissa] All right, who turned the "Magic 
      Fingers" on?

>                      Eleven of the fifteen struck home, 
>catching them completely off-guard.
>     "Back us off!  Reverse!  FOR GOD'S SAKES, *REVERSE*!"  
>Picard shouted, tumbling back into her chair.

 Tom: [Marrissa] No, that's park, you imbecile!

>                                               Jay clutched 
>tightly at his own armrests to avoid being thrown.

Mike: [Jay] They didn't say anything about vibrating chairs
      in a battle!

>                                                    They 
>were buffeted like a canoe being struck by ocean waves.

 Tom: Buffeted? Are they served for dinner?
Crow: Don't talk about food, I'm getting hungry.

>     "Shields at eighty-nine percent!"  Shayna reported.
>     "Get Clara on it.  Lynn, you're relieved."

Mike: Marrissa! This is no time for an acting 
      workshop!

>                                                 Marrissa 
>ordered, moving to the front of the bridge.  Lynn Gordon, 
>Jay's youngest sister,

Crow: And Associate Professor from Rochester.

>                       slunk out of the seat, letting the 
>admiral take over.

Mike: Wow. Marrissa's really dedicated to tearing down the
      whole Gordon family, isn't she?
 Tom: Slunk? Slipped? Are these guys all lizards?

>                    She was a good pilot,

 Tom: Good? She's the best!
[Crow snickers.]
Mike: Huh?

>                                          she knew, but 
>Marrissa was the best.  The ship moved back, giving them 
>some maneuvering range.
>     "Admiral," Alexander Rozhenko called from the Ops 
>position,

[All jump, startled.]
 All: Aaaaah!
 Tom: Don't EVER do that!
Mike: When the heck did he show up?

>          "sensor readings indicate they have ten thousand 
>quantum torpedoes,

Crow: [Alex] A million SWATbots, fifty thousand TIE 
      fighters, and a google X-Wings.

>                   and their phasers are running directly 
>from their fusion cores."

Crow: Ah, Sisko's powergaming more than Marrissa!

>     From tactical, Shayna Sachs looked up from her console 
>long enough to balk.

 Tom: [Shayna] Nuts!

>                      "We'd need twenty of us to match 
>that!"

Crow: [Marrissa] Brilliant! Ensign, get a huge replicator
      and clone 20 of us!

>     Picard worked feverishly at the helm.  "We can't match 
>it.  We have to beat it."

 Tom: [Shayna] Yes, ma'am! Creating fifty billion quantum 
      torpedoes out of nothing!

>     Sachs squinted.  It wasn't uncommon for Marrissa to 
>ask the impossible;

Crow:  Like the time she'd wanted to disguise the ship as a
       huge, flying strawberry!

>                    over the last week, she'd started to 
>miss it.  "Yes ma'am!"  She locked onto the damaged section 
>of Pylon 3, trying to get some leverage in their attention 
>focus.
>

Mike: Forget the important parts of the station, just shoot
      a teeny pylon!

>     Bashir shook his fist slightly in triumph,

Crow: Again with the "slightly" talk.
 Tom: And Bashir slightly bit his tongue as he saw the 
      slightly tilted starship slightly shoot them...

>                                                as the 
>Enterprise reeled from the torpedo strike. 
>     Sisko could appreciate the sentiment,

 All: So do we!

>                                           but not for 
>long.

Mike: [Sisko] These good moments NEVER last long.

>      The massive ship, over a kilometer-and-a-half of 
>Starfleet's most advanced technologies,

Crow: Including the new quantum powered shoe buffers 
      and the Galthion Espresso Maker. 

>                                        wasn't nearly 
>finished with them.

 Tom: It was "slightly" finished with them.

>                     As fast as they backed off, they swept 
>across for another strike.

Crow: [Announcer] Star Trek: 2nd Strike! Only in theatres!

>                            It was far easier to hit a 
>stationary target than a moving one,

 Tom: Unless you're attacking a very small stationary 
      target or a very huge moving target.

>                                     and the station just
>didn't have the engineering resources the flagship did.  
>Shield status on the Enterprise was already climbing again.

Crow: Yes, with Marrissa's endorsement, shields were "in"!

>     The ship hurtled past like a banshee,

Mike: Or like Mariah Carey, which is pretty much the same 
      thing.

>                                           raining blasts 
>at the damaged pylon.  Sisko cursed.

 Tom: [Sisko] Smoo! Flark! Belgium!

>                                      Directly below that 
>pylon, still clinging to the docking ring, still cloaked, 
>Nog had to be wondering if the Defiant had been detected.

Crow: If it was, you'd be dead by now.

>     Ops rattled again.

Mike: Careful--that means it's about to bite!

>                         Dax had all but abandoned the 
>sensors to concentrate on retaliatory fire, but it looked 
>as though Admiral Picard herself was at the helm.

 Tom: Yeah, the Admiral's out for blood!

>                                                   They 
>managed to evade every phaser bolt.

Mike: Which meant either Dax was too predictable to 
      Marrissa, or someone's been hiding her Betazed
      abilities...

>     Kira was working damage control, loudly.

 Tom: [Kira] You, get the baking soda! You, use a wet
      towel! You, roll on the ground! You, panic like 
      an idiot!

>                                              If they were 
>still there next week, O'Brien would have his work cut out 
>for him down below.

Crow: Well, you should've thought of that before letting 
      him go.

>                     Kelo shouted, jumping back as a 
>conduit burst into flame. 
>     Bashir snagged an emergency suppression tank,

Crow: What does that do?
 Tom: Suppress emergencies?
Mike: Sounds useful! Maybe Gypsy could build one.

>                                                   tossing 
>it to the Bajoran officer.  She caught it, and started to 
>put the flames out.

Crow: All hail the elusive Kelo!
 All: Hail Kelo!

>     Sisko, breathing heavily through the acrid haze, 
>closed his eyes. It was as though the haze was inside his 
>eyelids.

 Tom: Is *everyone* in this fic on drugs?

>     "The Sisko doubts."

Mike: [Sisko] The Sisko thanks the Troi.

>     His eyes snapped open, but Ops was gone.  His office 
>was filled with the same haze.  "Not now!"  He called. 

Mike: [Sisko] I'm kinda in the middle of my death scene,
      guys. Can't you wait 'til after I'm dead?
 
>"We're being attacked!  You said we had difficulties to 
>face, that I would affect the outcome!  Let me do it!"

 Tom: [The Prophets] The Sisko is eager to die too easily.

>     Syral appeared before him.  "You are linear.  You do 
>not understand.  You . . . will."

Mike: This chapter brought to you by the Sci-Fi Channel.
Crow: Ever wonder?

>     He stopped.  A prophet, using the future tense?  They 
>were learning.

 Tom: Good, they're FINALLY using "Hooked on Phonics"!

>                "I won't learn anything, unless you let me 
>back there."

Crow: [Sisko] Trial and error. Works every time!

>     A new face appeared which gave Sisko pause.  He didn't 
>recognize who it was, but he was disturbingly familiar.  
>Blonde, athletic, mid-thirties, wearing an old command 
>tunic . . .

 All: Uh-oh.
Crow: Oh great! Shatner's wormed his way into *this* series too!
 Tom: Mike? Is that you?
Mike: Ha-ha.

>     "The One comes.

 Tom: Bono?

>                      He is that which breaks the tie.

Crow: He is assisted by the Two and the Three.
Mike: Oh, it's Judge Rehnquist.

>                                                        He 
>will make all as it is."  The voice, familiar . . .

Mike: It's Ben Stein!
 Tom: Soon Ben Sisko will try to win! Ben! Stein's!
 All: Money!

>     "Emissary?"  Kira shook Sisko's shoulder, but he was 
>in some kind of trance.

Mike: Admiral Sisko can not come to the phone right now, 
      but if you leave your name and telephone number after
      the tone...

>                         "Benjamin, wake up!  The 
>Enterprise --" Another explosion knocked her back.  Sisko 
>continued to stand, oblivious to the momentary failure of 
>the inertial dampeners.

[Tom snores.]
Crow: Um, Sisko? Your back's on fire... hello? Hello?

>                         His eyes opened, and his head 
>snapped back.

Mike: [Sisko] I am Kirok!

>               Kira rose to her feet, watching him jump to 
>life.  He operated the controls without moving his eyes.  
>Leaning in, the Admiral could see his pupils, completely 
>dilated.

 Tom: The space optometrists have struck again!

>     "A Prophet!"  She backed off, letting him do whatever 
>needed to be done.
>     Phasers and torpedoes erupted from the station, 
>catching the Enterprise as she came about.  Despite her 
>fantastic maneuvering, every shot connected.
>

Crow: Mike, that *must* be you! Why didn't you tell us
      you were a Bajoran prophet?
Mike: It was just a temp job, Crow.

>     "THE HELL!?"

 Tom: (TM).

>     Picard couldn't understand it.  No matter how she 
>moved the ship, another explosion sounded around them.

Crow: So how does it feel to be the Bismarck? Pretty 
      crummy, I would imagine.

>     "Shields to fourteen percent!

 Tom: Sisko's using those Teflon coated torpedoes.

>                                    Marrissa, they've got 
>some way to target us!  They've fired over fifty rounds, 
>and haven't missed once!"

Crow: They're using god mode!
Mike: Those bastards!

>                           Sachs managed to cry. 

 Tom: It was good for the rest of the bridge crew to see 
      her open up emotionally like that.

>                                                  "Another 
>minute, and we'll be hulled!"

Mike: This must be what shrimp feel like at Red Lobster.

>     The admiral pounded the console in frustration.

 Tom: Great idea, Marrissa. Like Lynn hasn't done that 
      before!

>                                                      This 
>was absolutely impossible!  Without a second thought, she

Crow: And warped right INTO DS9. The end.

>                           Snapping into subspace, the 
>turbulence ceased.
>     "How?"  Marrissa demanded, turning in her chair.  "How 
>did they do that?

Mike: [Marrissa] And why couldn't *I* do it?

>                   They targeted us as though we were just 
>sitting there!

 Tom: You *were* just sitting there!
Mike: She meant the ship.
 Tom: Oh.

>                This is the *flagship*.  We're better than 
>anything else in the fleet!"

 Tom: [Marrissa] Except for that USS General Lee.
Mike: [Jay] By the way, where's Sara?

>     Jay shrugged, helplessly.  "We should call your

Crow: [Marrissa] I'd rather call my lawyer.

>         He can get the other ships here in less than an

>     Picard glowered at him.

 Tom: [Jay] Sorry, honey. I'll never try to make sense 
      again.

>                              "My father didn't bring me

Mike: [Jay, matter-of-factly] Did he? Did he really?

>                                       I'm bringing us

Crow: [Marrissa] Spaceship or no spaceship... oops, that
      didn't come out right.

>            We'll use the Denorios Belt to hide in,

Mike: Hey, isn't that the thing Pumaman wears?

>                                                    fool 
>their sensors.  There are too many asteroids for them to 
>target accurately, and we can send the fighters in as a 
>diversionary offensive fleet."

 Tom: [Marrissa] We'll even use a tractor beam and toss 
      some asteroids at them!
Crow: I was wondering when they'll use it for some silly
      attack.

Mike: All together now...
[All follow Alexander's words precisely.]

>one against.  Or so I'm told."

 Tom: Oh, thank you, goldenrod.
Crow: Huh?
 Tom: Not you.

>     Picard made a sour face.  "Computers can be so 
>cynical.

Mike: It's probably because they listen to the Cure a lot.

>          I've been training in holographic asteroid fields 
>since I was eleven.

 Tom: [Alexander] That's nice. When did you start making it
      out alive?
Mike: Hrmph. I bet that she doesn't know the "leave one 
      asteroid and shoot the ufos" trick.

>                     We're coming about!"

>her.

Mike: Whazzup?

>      "Marrissa, it's obvious you're feeling very tense, 
>and you think you need to prove something,

Crow: Well, she's probably overcompensating for something.

>                                           but we need you, 
>as the admiral in command of this ship, to be objective.  
>It's no shame to ask for reinforcements."

 Tom: [Marrissa, whining] But Sisko's gonna call me a 
      wussie!

>     She nodded.  "Thank-you, Martin.  You've earned your 
>paycheck.  Now, sit down and be quiet."

Mike: For once I agree with Marrissa.
 Tom: Really.
Crow: Martin? Repeat after me: "Captain? I'm sensing great
      hostility from that ship.."

>     He bit the inside of his cheek, and took his seat.

[All groan in sympathy]
Crow: Oh, poor Martin!
Mike: They're gonna need to start a support group for all
      the men whose egos have been destroyed by Marrissa.
 Tom: And some of the girls. Don't forget poor Lynn.

>     Picard touched her communicator.  "Bridge to Lochard.

>people on the horn, and whoever we have left from Deep 
>Space Nine."

Crow: [Marrissa] And I don't wanna hear any complaints 
      about shooting on their old station, got it?

>     As the Enterprise vanished, Sisko tumbled to the deck.  
>Kira and Bashir rushed over to him, the doctor giving him a 
>hypospray.

 Tom: [Sisko] Doctor, shouldn't you be using that? Dammit! 
      I'm an ex-admiral not a doctor!

>     With a gasp, he sat up.  "It's not over.  She's coming 
>back --"

Mike: And *this* time, it's personal! 

>     "Emissary, what did the Prophets want?"  Kira asked,

 Tom: [Sisko] Fajitas. A whole truckload of 'em.
 
>kneeling beside him, supporting his back.
>     He smiled.  "They want the best of all possible 
>universes.

Crow: Oh. They want California then.
Mike: The prophets are secretly Voltaire?

>            But we have to act fast.  The last thing they 
>said was 'time is of the essence.'" He stood, shakily.  
>"Where's the Enterprise?"

Crow: [Kira] Wednesday nights on UPN, I think.

>     "They warped off, after you began that maelstrom.  How 
>did you target like that?"  Dax asked, from his console.

Mike: [Sisko] Didn't you know? I've been playing station
      combat simulators since I was seven!

>     "I didn't.

Crow: [Sisko] I shot off wildly like a maniac and got 
      lucky.

>                 One of them must have used me as a host.  
>That's extremely difficult for them, while I'm outside the 
>wormhole.  Did you see anything enter or leave me?"
>     No-one had.

Mike: But they lied to make him feel better.

>                  Other visitations from the wormhole 
>aliens had visible effects, usually a bluish energy streak; 

 Tom: This time, however, the special effects department was 
      too busy with the space battle to concentrate on Sisko's 
      visitations.

>but then, Sisko never had a normal relationship with the 
>Prophets.

Crow: Never went out, never hugged, never talked about 
      the Packers...

>           They usually only talked to him, directly.

Mike: Directly with indirect references?

>     He took a deep breath, asking for status.  The shields 
>were at sixty-eight percent, and holding.  Phasers were 
>still within two percent of optimal, and they had more than 
>ninety-nine percent of their torpedoes left.

 Tom: Which meant they still had all two of them.

>                                              The Defiant 
>was untouched, and the repair crews were already

 Tom: [Repair crewman #1] Pass me that pile of Play-d'oh
      over there.
Crow: [Repair crewman #2] I think chewing gum would do
      much better...

>     He was almost ready to believe their luck, when 
>another explosion impacted the shields.

Mike: The cloaked Defiant accidentally put the engines 
      in reverse...
 Tom: And hilarity ensued!

>     Dax was already on it.  "Torpedo from the Denorios 
>Belt!  We've got incoming fighters, on approach!"
>

 Tom: [Dax] It's Wedge Antilles and Rogue Squadron! We're
      doomed now!

>     The Enterprise ducked behind an asteroid five 
>kilometers across.

Crow: Then Sheridan gave the order to detonate the nuclear 
      warhead on the asteroid, destroying the Enterprise. 
      The end.
Mike: Hrmph. Honor Harrington would kicked all of their 
      behinds by now.

>                    Their last salvo seemed to have caught 
>the station off-guard.  Without surprise, they would have 
>to rely on the fighters to provide a distraction.
>     "Repeat, I want all pilots in the fighters, now!"  

Mike: [Marrissa] And make some space in your fighters if 
      there's too many of you! I want EVERY pilot accounted
      for!

>Marrissa closed the comm frequency.  Nearly a hundred of 
>the small craft had been launched already.  They couldn't 
>do much against the station shields, but they'd do enough.  
>The rest was up to the cruiser now dodging rocks.

 Tom: Fed up by the Federation presence in their sector, 
      rock-throwing Bajoran demonstrators vented their 
      anger at the Enterprise.

>     A signal came in.  "Enterprise, this is Lieutenant 
>Kennison with Magenta Squad.  Commander Lochard and Rogue 
>Squad are engaging the enemy.

 Tom: That's sad. The one time "rouge" would have been
      appropriate, and Keeler blows it.
Crow: Mike? How can we riff the story when it keeps making 
      our riffs into reality?

>                               Magenta Squad requesting 
>clearance to engage."

Crow: [Marrissa] No, you may not engage. I just sent you
      out there for fun.

>     "Go, Kennison.  Take the solar side.

Mike: Yeah, hey babe. Take a walk on the solar side.

 Tom: [Lochard] Or not. I'm not too sure. Just do something 
      fancy.
Crow: And it'll clear up your acne, too.
 
>Your communications systems may be affected, but you'll 
>have the advantage; just keep everyone in visual range!"

 Tom: [Lochard] Just make sure that they're not directly 
      in front of you when you fire, okay, Kennison? We
      don't want the same thing as last time.

>     The boy complied.

Mike: Boy? Alright, who let Anakin Skywalker in this fanfic?

>                        Lochard reported that the station 
>was avoiding retaliation against the smaller ships, that 
>they were waiting for the Enterprise to show.

Crow: [Lochard, whining] Come on! We're trying to destroy
      you too! Pay attention! Hello? No fair!

>     The admiral nodded.  The distraction needed a little 
>punch to be effective.

 Tom: So we're adding a little more tequila into it!

>                        "Simultaneous targeting, 
>coordinates one-four-four mark three-nine.  Keep clear!"

Mike: Allemande left! Keep your powder dry! I've
      got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

 Tom: The bowling alley. If the crew can't play their 
      ten frames, morale goes straight to hell.

>                 It got their attention.

Mike: [DS9] Hey! Are you trying to hurt me?

Crow: You can tell when Sisko's in there pounding the fire 
      button with his head, shouting "No! No! No! No!"

>                                    The fighters,

Mike: Someone radioed "Hey look! A big distracting thing!"
      and they fell for it, hook, line and sinker.

 Tom: Burgundy? Why is a country from the Middle Ages

Crow: They have those cool space horses.

Mike: So where are the Crimson, Cherry, Tomato, Scarlet,
      Ruby, Blood, and Fire-Engine squads?

>     Marrissa recognized her chance.

Crow: And she warped straight out of the system.
Mike: [Marrissa] Woo-hoo! Forget the battle! We're going to 
      Cabo, boys!

Crow: Uhh... why is Marrissa doing this again?
Mike: Because Sisko was rude to her.
Crow: Oh. [pause] If she ever finds us, we're dead, 
      aren't we?

>     One by one, they collided against the weakening 
>shields. Retaliation was light and easily avoided,

Mike: All they did was hold up a piece of paper and said
      "But you promised!"

 Tom: [Computer] Access denied. *I* wanna blow up the 
      station! Me me me me me!

>     A static-filled message came in from Magenta Squad.

Crow: It said something about the anti-god heading back to
      1999. Then it had a pointless cameo from Alice Cooper.
 
>Communications were terribly garbled, but Picard could 
>barely make out the gist: the fighters were in trouble,

Crow: Someone clogged their engines with strawberry jam.

>                                                        and 
>they couldn't reorganize without returning to the ship.

 Tom: [Marrissa] What a bunch of wimps! I've been 
      reorganizing without returning to the ship since I
      was 8!

>     An explosion sounded, and the communications were cut.

Mike: [Marrissa] Finally! That static was giving me a 
      headache!

>     "Enterprise!  This is Lochard -- we've just lost half 
>of Magenta Squad!  It looks as though . . ."

 Tom: [Lochard] They blew up.
Mike: Brilliant observation.

>                                              Her voice 
>came through the speaker sounding pale.  "Oh my god, they 
>killed Kennison!"

 Tom: Uh-oh.
Crow: It's like he's daring us!
Mike: Brace yourself. This one's going to hit us hard.

>     Marrissa focused on the viewscreen, watching the 
>battle unfolding, realizing that another young life had 
>just been lost.

Crow: Uhhh, and just who *sent* him out there instead of
      asking for reinforcements?
Mike: [Marrissa] I just realized, the whole Kids' Crew 
      idea may not be such a good idea after all... ha, 
      who am I kidding?

>                 The last vestiges of her compassion for 
>the station crew fled with the end of that transmission.  
>She shook her head, slightly.

 Tom: Then she slightly spat at the slightly tired Jay.

>                               "You bastards."

 All: [groan]
Mike: Do you two still have your list?
 Tom: Yep.
Mike: Add Keeler.
Crow: Gladly.

>     "Twenty fighters just hit the shields!"  Kira 
>exclaimed.

 Tom: Deep Space Bug Zapper 9.

>           "Section beta is beginning to collapse."  She 
>shook her head.  "This piece of junk never could take

 Tom: Remind me never to put you in charge of the Pacific 
      theater in WWII.

>     Another series of explosions made the deck lurch 
>beneath them. Sisko managed to keep himself standing by the 
>narrowest of margins. He tried again to target the 
>Enterprise, now roaring towards them,weapons flaring.

Crow: [Sisko] Damn, this wasn't so hard when I was 
      possessed by god-boy!

>     "Got it!"  Dax shouted triumphantly.

 Tom: [Syral] Bingo!

>                                           "All weapons

Crow: [Sisko] Any earlier and I would've kissed you!

>                             You watch the fighters, I'll 
>handle Admiral Picard."

 Tom: [Sisko] I'm gonna aim all the way to Corvaldis IV and
      hit the other ships!

>                         Sisko said, reorienting the weapon 
>systems.  All three turrets lanced toward the oncoming ship 
>simultaneously.  The Enterprise swerved expertly, eluding 
>the beams.  Sisko smacked his palm across the rail.  
>"Alright, dodge this!"
>

Mike: The Enterprise avoided his palm! 
 Tom: Those evasive bastards!
Crow: [Marrissa] Hah! I've been dodging torpedoes since I
      was 4!

>     One hundred quantum torpedoes lit up space.

Mike: Say what you will about this, the people of Bajor 
      are probably having the best fireworks display 
      they've seen in a long while.

>                                                  The 
>starship crew watched in horror as their entire field of 
>vision swam with the deadly beacons.

 Tom: Photon torpedoes or Sakura petals? YOU decide!

>                                      Shayna tried to 
>target them with the ship's phasers, but couldn't lock on.  

Crow: How about shooting wildly? I'm sure detonating just
      one of them would detonate them all.

>Marrissa's fingers danced at warp speeds to avoid
>collision,

 Tom: Then she got carried away and did the polka.

>           but there were too many in their way.  Finally, 
>she looked up, squeezed her eyes shut, and shouted, "Brace 
>yourselves!"
>     The flagship reeled backwards, catching a torpedo 
>directly beneath the forward hull.

Mike: A fly out to end the inning.

>                                    Sparks blew out a 
>library console,

 Tom: Damn! There went the only shipboard copy of _The 
      Scarlet Letter_.

>                 and a lieutenant stumbled back.

Mike: Note to self: sparks hitting a console creates
      officers out of thin air. Keep that in mind.

>                                                  Picard 
>hit one button,

 Tom: *FWOOSH!*

>                hoping their hull integrity wouldn't 
>buckle.  The Enterprise shot off, tangential to the
>approaching missiles, catching only two more.  Another 
>explosion revealed the extent of their damage.

Crow: Which was total destruction, the end.

>     "Hull breach, deck thirty-nine.

Mike: I cut, you deal.

Crow: Time to go into detox.
 Tom: [Marrissa] And if Clara told you that the boogieman
      was in the closet, would you believe her too?

>                           Alex growled through the smoke.

Crow: Marrissa misinterpreted it as a Klingon come-on and 
      soon the two were going at it like crazed ice weasels.

>     Marrissa felt pure rage sweep into her.

Mike: [Marrissa] Wow! Losing sucks!

>                                              Her back was

 Tom: [muffled] Hey, I can't see what's going on? What's 
      going on?

 Tom: [Marrissa] Beaten by an antique! How quaint.

Crow: Shayna, quit giving Marrissa the bi-atch look.

>                                   Jay worried,

Mike: [Jay] Oh gosh. I sure hope they renew "Pop Stars".

 Tom: [Alex] Avocado colored walls? These decorators have
      no honor!

Crow: [Martin] I hope no one realizes I don't really serve 
      a purpose on this ship.

Mike: Just like the enemy gate.

Crow: It's kinda like when you listen to static to see if 
      the TV is on in the other room.

>                                    He touched the door.  
>Still locked, but that wasn't a problem.  He turned himself 
>into a liquid, and seeped out into the corridor.  
>Reforming, he looked about.  No guards.

 Tom: Some security. Trusting too much on a force-field when 
      you're in the middle of a battle. Nice going, Sisko.
Crow: All at once, all of the prisoners on DS9 made... their
      GREAT ESCAPE!

>     Hurrying toward the promenade, Odo considered his only 
>option: Quark.

Mike: The cancelled show about the space garbage scow?
 Tom: I can't believe him. He's escaping, and all he can 
      think about is going back to work.
Crow: [Odo] Maybe if I catch Quark in yet another stupid 
      scheme, Sisko will give me my job back!

>                                   that the Defiant was 
>still here,

 Tom: And still doing absolutely nothing.

Mike: [Marrissa] Don't care. Must sate blood lust!

>                        If they would listen.

Mike: Han Solo would tell you to quit complaining, Old Man.

      than saving lives.

 Tom: Oh, so that's why he's there, so he can be the

 Tom: [Kira] I'm committing mutiny, sir.

>     "Admiral?  Have they broken off?"

Crow: [Kira] No! They're 100% natural, you pervert!
 
>                                       Bashir asked, as 
>another salvo hit the station.  "Never mind."

 Tom: [Sisko] Sorry, that was me. I just fired at my own
      shields.

>     She was working at something else.

Mike: [Bashir] Could you put off that tool-shed for
      another day? We're kinda busy!

>                                         "The fusion 
>reactors are nearing critical.  We've got to shut down, or 
>we'll lose half the station!"

 Tom: [Sisko] But we can still fight, right?

>     Sisko raised his eyebrows.  "Seeing as how we'll lose 
>both halves otherwise, it may be our only choice.  We can't 
>target something as small as a fighter with quantum 
>torpedoes."

Crow: [Sisko] I know! We'll fire indiscriminately!

>     "We can't target them with phasers right now, either.  
>Give me a moment . . ."

 Tom: [Sisko] Tell the fighters to hold off their attack 
      until I think of a new strategy to kill them.

>     "If we have a moment," Dax finished dryly.  "Not to be 
>cynical."
>     Kira turned her attention to the targeting sensor.  
>"That's more like it!

Mike: [Kira] They're purposely slowing down so we CAN fire
      at them! How thoughtful...

>                       If the chief were here, or we had 
>more time, we could switch the tractor scanner with the 
>phaser targeting array.  As it is, this will have to do!"
>     A blue light shot out of the turret.

 Tom: Attention, Deep Space Shoppers! There is a blue light
      special on torpedoes in aisle 3 ...

>                                           It caught half a 
>dozen fighters, immobilizing them.

Crow: [Kira] Stay! Good fighters! Now die horribly.

>     Dax smiled widely.  "Tractor beam, wide dispersal 
>pattern."
>     Bashir slapped the bulkhead in appreciation.

 Tom: [Bulkhead] Owie! Some appreciation!

>                                                   "Doesn't 
>need much power to hold, because of their small mass.  
>That's why they made you an admiral, Nerys!"

Mike: Fishing shows of the future are much cooler than 
      they are now!

>                        "I know why I was promoted, 
>Doctor."

 Tom: It was her poetry reading, right?
 
>         As they stopped, like the first group, she 
>smiled.  "But thank-you, Julian."
>     A few scattered fighters scurried about, but they had 
>little effect on the shields.  Remodulating the tractor

>them from inflicting further damage.

Crow: So technically, the small ships were pretending to be
      in a Ferris wheel. Sounds like fun!

>                                      It couldn't be too 
>much fun for the pilots, Sisko noted.  From what the 
>Prophets had shown him, they would all be on the same side, 
>of the same ideas, very soon.

 Tom: That 'very soon' turns out to be 'never', as 
      amalgamation of the galaxy becomes far-fetched.

 All: Tor Johnson!

>     "Hang on!"

>     Shayna let loose with everything they had.

Mike: She even tossed Marrissa's "N'sync" albums at them!

>indiscriminately, was there?

Crow: Later, at the court martial, while the families of the
      destroyed neutral merchants watched, Marrissa admitted
      that might have been a mistake.

>     Twenty quantum torpedoes sailed out, cascading along 
>the shield.  Their phasers blasted again and again, having 
>some effect, at least.

 Tom: The effect? Things blew up real good.

>                       She tried not to hit their own 
>fighters, suspended by tractor beams, but a few small 
>plumes reflected the problem with that strategy.

Mike: In other words, human shields make the station more 
      difficult to destroy.

>     Marrissa saw it, too.  "Shayna, disengage!"
>     The Enterprise stopped in space.

Crow: And that ends the first half of play.
 Tom: And now, our half-time report, brought to you by the 
      good people of Pespi!

>     Why don't they destroy them?  Marrissa wondered.  
>They're a constant threat, as long as they orbit the 
>station.  She got her answer a moment later.

Mike: As torpedoes blow all the fighters up.

>                                              Spreading the 
>beams out, the fighters spread across the Enterprise's 
>range of sight.

 Tom: [DS9] Dare you to take the fighters! Come on, I dare
      ya! Take 'em!

>                 More indiscriminate shooting would 
>certainly kill more of their people; but they weren't about 
>to abandon those pilots, either!
>     "Their bluff," Picard noted.  Maybe this could buy 
>Clara a few minutes.
>
>     "Our bluff," Sisko noted.  "They won't destroy their 
>own people,

 Tom: Are we talking about the same Marrissa?

>            and we have little left for defense.  
>Torpedoes?"

Mike: [Syral] No thanks. Do you have any coffee?

>     Dax shrugged.  "Targeting damaged in the last assault.  
>We can try that rapid-fire trick again, but I'd bet they're 
>just waiting for it."
>     Sisko crossed his arms, thoughtfully.  "And I don't

 Tom: [Sisko] I already reached my "thirty people" limit.

>                                   If the only way to stop 
>Admiral Picard is to destroy the Enterprise, we have a

>     "What about the Prophets?"

Crow: [Sisko] They're in Houston this weekend.

>                                 Kira asked, letting the 
>straining computer handle the fighters.  "Did they give you 
>any more idea about what you have to do?"

 Tom: [Sisko] They said "Nuts to you, we'll find another 
      Emissary!" and stormed out... I'm sure that's a good
      sign.

>     He sighed.  "Unfortunately, yes.  If they're right, 
>those fifteen-hundred lives are inconsequential, except for 
>a few.

Mike: Not that their families will want to exact revenge or
      anything.

>        But, the Enterprise itself is absolutely critical 
>for the sake of the future."

Crow: [Sisko] We have a few more Star Trek movies scheduled
      for it!

>                              He closed his eyes.
>     A moment later, he opened them again.  "Aces high.  
>Nothing wild."

 Tom: Ante up! Start at five quantum torpedoes.

>     Odo reached the Promenade.  Panicked Bajorans were 
>racing around, shouting and calling for help.

Mike: Gee, general panic, many people running around... 
      brings back a lot of memories.
 Tom: Save it, at least you didn't watch any Gamera movies.

>                                               Nearing

Crow: He was cushioned by Odo's goopy state.
 Tom: Into him? Ewww... the man's been slimed.

>     "Odo!  Thank the Prophets!

Crow: [Odo] Okay. Thank you, Prophets.

>                                 I can't see very far; help 
>me -- where is the infirmary?"

Mike: [Odo] Oh, we're not using that set this week.

>     Looking towards the bar, Odo held the injured man up.  
>"This way,"

 Tom: [Odo] We'll get you some vodka for that wound.

>            he said with a sigh.  Even relieved of duty, he 
>was on-duty.

Crow: He worked double-shifts this way.

>              He began directing traffic, trying to keep 
>more people from becoming hurt.
>     Reaching the infirmary, he passed the man to Nurse 
>Jabara,

 Tom: ... who kicked him between the goalposts for an
      extra 3 points!

>        then made his way over to his office.
>     "Odo!"  The deputy on duty was startled to see the 
>shape-shifter there. "You're supposed to be confined . . ."

Mike: [Quark] By the way, I didn't really know Kira was 
      into that stuff...

>     "Spare me!"  Odo shouted,

 Tom: [Odo] Please! I wanna work again! Wahhhhh!

>                               "Why aren't you on the 
>Promenade?

Crow: [deputy] I'm scared of confined spaces and the traffic
      is horrendous!

>            Come on, we have to get these people to safety; 
>then we can decide where I should be locked up!"
>     Swallowing, the young Bajoran nodded, and they began 
>maneuvering through the mobs.

 Tom: Well, it looks like a normal soccer game just finished.

>                               Directing the flow of 
>bodies,

Crow: That sounds oddly disturbing.

>        Odo felt he was at least contributing in some way.  
>But he still had to find . . .

 Tom: ...a diet cola without a yucky aftertaste!

>     An orange hand tugged on his sleeve.

Crow: What's Ernie doing on DS9?

>                                           "Constable, I 
>thought you were locked up!"  Quark said, clinging to his 
>oldest adversary.  "Do I get a reward for catching you?"

 Tom: [Odo] Yes, do you want a punch in the jaw?

>     "Quark!  I was looking for you --"
>     "Oh, I bet!  Trying to blame *this* one on me, Odo?

Mike: [Odo] Yes. If it weren't for your Bolian tea, none 
      of this wouldn't have happened!

>                                                          I 
>think it's beautiful irony that between the two of us, you 
>would be the one locked up by Sisko!"

Crow: Who would then by locked up by Marrissa! Yeah, how 
      ironic. Everyone's arresting everybody.

>                                       He shook his toothy 
>bald head in mock-pity.  "Oh the life --"

Mike: [Quark] Of two star-crossed jailbirds...

>     "Shut up, Quark!  I need a favor from you."  Odo 
>struggled to hold a conversation while trying to keep 
>people moving.

Mike: Multi-tasking was never Odo's thing.

>     "I only ever seem to do 'favors' for you.  When are 
>you going to pay me for my services?"

 Tom: [Odo] The next morning, honey.

>                                       The bartender 
>demanded.  "I'll get you whatever you want, provided you 
>look the other way when I tell you to."

Crow: [Quark] All I want is to just say "Made you look!" 
      just once!

>     "When?"  The constable asked, wearily.
>     "From.  Now.  On."  Quark replied smugly.
>     Odo shouted for order, his voice falling on deaf ears.  
>"Quark, get me communications access to the Federation, and 
>I *won't* release a Tiberian mouse into the bulkhead above 
>your quarters.  Just think of the scratching, the clicking, 
>every night when you're trying to sleep . . ."

 Tom: [Quark] Sounds kinda neat!

>     The Ferengi swallowed, self-consciously touching his 
>enormous ear.

Mike: Quark must've been a descendent of Ross Perot.

>               "Very well, Constable.  One transmission for 
>one transgression. I'll keep Ops looking the other way, if 
>you'll just stay away from the cargo bays next Thursday."

 Tom: [Odo] Joke's on him. We're doing a pesticide sweep in
      the cargo bays next Thursday!

>     "Agreed."  Odo replied curtly.  He didn't care if 
>Quark made a profit of a million bars; this communication 
>was important.

>     Every single person on the bridge stood.

Mike: o/~ Oh, say can you see... o/~

Crow: ...causing a vacuum on the bridge, killing the crew. 

>     Torpedoes flew toward them.  A lot of torpedoes.  

Mike: A gathering of torpedoes is technically the plural.
Crow: What's being fired at?
 Tom: Does it really matter at this point?

>Marrissa soundlessly drove the ship backwards, watching the 
>projectiles advance.

Crow: Ah. There's my answer.
Mike: Marrissa's doing the Kaufmann Retrograde! Cool!

>                      A solid wall of the things spewed 
>out.

 Tom: Sisko, you crazy bastard, I love you!
Mike: Keeler, I love you too for bringing us this moment!

>      Shayna was counting from behind, "Four hundred 
>twenty, four hundred forty . . ."
>

Mike: [Marrissa] Shayna! Count the torpedoes and stop
      playing Tetris!
 Tom: [Shayna] Sorry! One...two...

>     "One thousand?"

Crow: It's DS9's new trick, a magazine discharge.

>                      Dax asked, watching the count reel 
>through the computer.  "Benjamin, have you heard of 
>*overkill*?"
>     Sisko shook his head.
>

Mike: [Sisko] It's Marrissa, damn it! I'm not sure if 
      even a thousand will kill that harpy!

>     "Impact in thirty seconds!"  Alexander shouted.  He 
>quickly opened a channel to his wife, and quietly said, 
>"Clara, I love you."

Crow: o/~ Clara, I love you. Loving you, is all I can do...o/~
Mike: Sorry, this is Ensign Ricky. What did you say?

>     "Eight hundred sixty!  They're still coming!  Marrissa

Mike: [Shayna] Um, this may be a bad time, but can you
      okay my vacation request? 
Bots: [chanting] Marrissa's going to die! Marrissa's 
      going to die!
Mike: Guys! We went over this already. We've read the sequel.
      How the Heck Ramsey is she going to die if there's a
      sequel?!

>     "That's it.  Engineering says the jerry-rigging just 
>cut out.

Crow: What does the electoral process have anything to 
      do with engineering?
Mike: She didn't say gerrymandering, Crow.

>possible."

 Tom: Ah. Ludicrous speed.
 
>           The admiral swallowed.

Mike: Yes, despite our doubts, she too is human.

>                                   Jay came up from 
>behind, and took her hand.

Crow: [Jay] Come on! Let's ride on out to case the
      Promised Land!

>                            Together, they watched the 
>waves of death hurtle their way.
>

Mike: [Marrissa] This is nothing.  I've been facing 
      waves of death since I was just a gleam in my
      father's eye!

>     "Disengage!  Benjamin!  The weapons turrets are . . ."

Crow: Extremely phallic?

>     The turrets were overheating; if space weren't so 
>cold, the metal would have glowed.  At once, all six 
>exploded.

Crow: Oh! And right before the station's big date with 
      the head cheerleader too!
 Tom: Sound familiar, Mike?
Mike: [softly] Shut up.

>           The cascade reaction ripped through the prepped 
>but still unfired torpedoes.

Mike: I thought the Cascade reaction was the thing that kept
      your glasses from spotting in the dishwasher.

>                              Unshielded, they waited for 
>the discharge to wash through the rest of the station,
>and consume them all.

 Tom: So everyone dies. Well, at least it all went out
      with a bang. Let's go now.
Mike: Sit down, Servo.

>                       And they waited.  Sisko seemed 
>unfazed.

Crow: Oh, he's having another vision again.

>     "Ben, what happened?"  Dax ventured, as it became 
>evident that they weren't about to die.

 Tom: [Sisko] Paramount must have renewed the series.

>     He raised his eyebrows innocently.  "I must have 
>forgotten to arm them."
>

Mike: [Sisko] I'm sure that those heavy objects hurtling
      through space at high speeds won't do any harm
      to anything.

>     Marrissa took a deep breath and held it, promising 
>silently never to complain about Sara, if she ever saw her 
>daughter again.  She felt Jay's hand tighten on her own.

Crow: [Marrissa] Jay? No touching.
Mike: [Jay] Sorry.

>     "Impact!"
>     A dull thud sounded.  Releasing her breath, the 
>admiral opened her eyes.  Hundreds of torpedoes overwhelmed 
>the viewer.  Another thud, and another.  It sounded like a 
>heavy hail all around them as the torpedoes tumbled through 
>the weak shield and bounced off the hull.

 Tom: [Marrissa] Sisko's throwing rocks at us? What is he
      expecting us to do? Hoping us to go outside and get 
      hit by these golf balls?

>     Relief ran through her veins.  The torpedoes weren't 
>active!  But why?

Crow: 'Cause Sisko wussed out, that's why.

>                   She refocused the sensors around the 
>storm of inert projectiles, and saw the weapon turrets 
>erupt.

 Tom: Onboard DS9, Tommy Lee Jones quickly arrived to take 
      control of the situation.

>     "He sacrificed their only defenses as a ruse?"  She 
>couldn't understand.

Mike: I guess on that account we can all agree.

>                      The Enterprise could take the station 
>at their leisure, now.  The tractor emitters were also 
>destroyed, releasing all the fighters.

 Tom: Looks like the ride for the pilots is over.
Crow: Several hundred lunches have been lost in the battle.

Mike: You know, if she's still alive.

>     Sachs complied happily, as glad as everyone to still

Crow: Well, except for Ensign Deathwish...
 Tom: *I'm* not feeling very happy to be alive right now.

>     It was over.  They had nothing left.  The Nova-class 
>starship was specifically designed to be able to conquer

Mike: It was hard to count because the battles were too
      fast to actually start counting kills.

>                                              Their phasers

      Show."

Mike: Unfortunately, Sisko wasn't expecting the Prophets
      to just leave a flaming paper bag by Marrissa's 
      door.

>     "Incoming hail, Benjamin," Kira reported.

 Tom: Changing to snow by mid-morning.

>                                              "Admiral

Mike: [Sisko] She'll be asking for strawberries. Better 
      start the replicators...

>      He put on a resolute face.  "On screen."
>     Marrissa appeared, haggard but smug.

Crow: Yup, that's our Marrissa, all right.
 Tom: Marrissa, you never change, even after a near-death
      situation.

>                                           "Now, Sisko.  I

>                    I want every scrap of Federation

 Tom: Great. Marrissa's the new number two.
Crow: [Sisko] You can't court-martial me! I QUIT!

Mike: When are they coming, anyway?
 Tom: [Jean-Luc] Marrissa's in trouble? Ah, no rush. Take 
      your time!

>I believe that ends our little game."

Crow: [Marrissa] Shall we play some tennis next time?

 Tom: We were waiting for that. [snicker]

Crow: [Marrissa] Hmm. Federation: Lots of planets, big navy. 
      Bajor: 1 Planet, very small navy which I now outgun.
      What to do, what to do?

>     Picard looked as though she were about to be sick.  

Mike: Combine that with her back, ankle, and baby problems, 
      adds up to one unhappy mammy.

      before they understand.

 Tom: Such variety in choices!

      shields since before I could crawl!

      Crew Exiting the Theater
[Mike lifts up Tom and all three leave the theater.]

[1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 6 . . .]

[The Bridge]
[The trio stands behind the console. ]

Mike: Wow.
Crow: Yeah. I don't think that I've ever seen a Marrissa
      battle sequence last that long before.
 Tom: Hrmph. I still think more things should have
      blown up.
Crow: Tom, you thought that about "The Matrix" too.
 Tom: They didn't even blow up a car! What kind of
      action film is it if they couldn't even have
      a car explode!
Crow: You made the same argument on why "What Women
      Want" sucked.
 Tom: Mel Gibson was in it! For things not to be
      exploding is inexcusable!
Mike: Guys, enough. Maybe it's just me, but does Sisko
      seem a bit off to you?
Crow: Bah. Standard Star Trek Plot #47. "One of the
      crew starts acting goofy." Been there. Done
      that. Watched them do it again and again in
      Voyager.
 Tom: It's just a question of what one Keeler is
      ripping off for this piece.
Mike: Come on, guys. Keeler might have done something
      original.
[The bots stare at Mike for a moment then burst
 out laughing.]
Crow: Mike, it's fanfic.
  Tom: An original idea in fanfic. That's rich.
Mike: [flatly] Yeah. Rich. Ha. Ha.
Crow: Anyway, I'm betting that Sisko had a
      transporter accident and his evil twin
      is loose on the station.
 Tom: Please. He's possessed by those mind
      controlling grubs. I mean, duh.
Crow: Nah. Too obvious. Maybe this is all
      an illusion of Barash.
 Tom: Mind grubs.
Crow: Or an evil Bajoran hypnotized him into
      taking over the station.
 Tom: Grubs.
Mike: Hey, maybe Sisko's in the body of
      a female lab assistant while she's
      running amok on the station.
[The bots stare at Mike.]
 Tom: Mike, that one was goofy, even for the
      original series.
Mike: [Sighs] Look, even if the guy is borrowing
      ideas, why are sure that he's taking
      them from Star Trek?
Crow: Good point! Maybe he's been grabbed by
      the Psi Corps! Or a doppelganger!
 Tom: Mind grubs.
Mike: Not everything is sci-fi, guys. Maybe
      he just wants to play a nice game of
      solitaire.
Crow: Or maybe Ensign Roberts threw his prized
      palm tree out the airlock.
 Tom: It's...
Crow: Tom, if you say mind grubs again...
 Tom: No. It's even simpler than that. He's
      flipped. The second rate rip-off of
      Jean Luc Picard has gone off the deep
      end and become a cross between David
      Koresh and Captain Hazelwood.
Crow: Oh.
Mike: I guess that makes sense...
  Tom: Or it could be the mind grubs.
[Mike and Crow sigh as the lights begin to
 flash.]
Mike: We'll discuss this later, Tom. Right
      now, WE'VE GOT MARRISSA SIGN!!

[Mike hits the lights and the door sequence begins.]

[6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . ]

[The trio enter and take their places.]
Crow: So, Tom. Are there any mind grubs in the theater?
 Tom: Nah. They avoid here since they lost an attack
      force to one of Mike's knocked over cokes.
Mike: And Crow said that spilling my drink was a bad thing.

 Tom: If he dies, he won't order anymore uprisings.

Crow: If he goes nuts, a lot of harm, particularly in his
      place.

 Tom: The ship fell apart to pieces right before it could

      of peanuts to Federation citizens on spaceflights?
Mike: Hey, those Bajorans supply an awful lot of those
      goobers.

Crow: Has she ever sounded any other way?
Mike: [Marrissa] But da-aad, I wanted to destroy the
      station! You said I could! WAHHHH!!
 Tom: You do that far too well, Mike.

>       but after everything she had been through, she felt 
>she deserved some leeway.

Mike: Marrissa has leeway? That's like calling the
      Amazon a small stream.

>                           She quickly explained her 
>concerns to him, but he shook his head.

 Tom: [Jean-Luc] I'm sorry, honey. Could you repeat that 
      in a form of a question?

>     She huffed as the channel closed.

Mike: Is it me, or did Marrissa just lose?
[Pause.]
 Tom: Alright, what have you done with Marrissa?
Crow: Even the Globetrotters have to lose sooner or later.

Mike: Unfortunately, Bajor was still packed full of

Crow: [Syral] They're asking if you can stop having 
      any more battles for the night. They're trying to

Mike: [Sisko] Hey, they're playing an episode of the 
      Three Stooges! God, they kill me!

      Emissary!

>     The Emissary smiled.  "It does always seem to come

      I might as well thank some of our sponsors who 
      stuck with us on the way...

 Tom: [Sisko] To hell with the claps, I'll just head off 
      before they start appreciating my speech.

Mike: About a lucky man who made the grade.

>She still hadn't seen his face, but he reported to her

>                        it was now called Temple's Gate. 

Mike: Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken and John Hurt
      soon arrived on the station, but left after three days.

Mike: Hey! Is that our first spelling error?
Crow: It's the first one I've noticed!
 Tom: Wow. We nearly made it out of here without seeing one.

      episode.

Crow: Just like letting a preteen command a starship.
 Tom: I have a feeling Ratliff's gonna have a long talk
      with Thomas about how the Marrissa universe should 
      be conducted.

>                 She let patterns dance across her vision

Crow: Which was odd, as it was stuffed with goose feathers.

Crow: In fact, she named her replicator "Billy".

Mike: But where would she be able to find mealworms in
      Romulan space?

 Tom: Hello force that vastly outnumbers us! Please 
      surrender now!

Crow: [Marrissa] Oh quit whining! You're not getting any 
      rest until I destroy everything, okay?

      getting old!

Crow: You are here.

>Watch TNG's "Conspiracy."

 Tom: Told you. 
Mike: Yeah, yeah. Mind grubs. We know.
 Tom: Heck, that thing's been obvious to us since Captain
      Nog came aboard!
Crow: We got it, Tom. Stop rubbing it in.

>What number host was Ezri?

Crow: [whining] We don't know! Okay?

>Who's the only person in ST history who could possibly hold 
>his own  against Marrissa Picard?

Mike: Er, Teri Garr?

>                                   Think about it.

 Tom: Oh! I know! It's Moriarty!
Mike: No, it's Hardcourt Fenton Mudd's wife!

Crow: Yeah, whatever. Mike, can we go now? This thing's 
      starting to depress me.
Mike: Sure, let's go.

 Tom: I should be happy Marrissa lost. Why am I not?
Crow: Because she's still around?
 Tom: Oh, right.

[Mike lifts Tom from his chair and all three exit the 
 theater.]

[1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 6 . . . ]

[The Bridge.]
[Mike, Tom and Crow stand behind the counter.]
Mike: Well, that was an interesting change of pace.
 Tom: Yeah, it wasn't quite as bad as a Marrissa 
      story usually is.
Crow: And, hey, it was great to see baldy opening
      up a can of whup-ass on Marrissa!
 Tom: And there weren't any sex scenes with Marrissa
      in this one!
[Mike shivers.]
Mike: Tom, please stop bringing that story up.
 Tom: Sorry. 
Crow: I guess Pearl messed up for once. 
Mike: Ah, she'll get even with us. She'll probably
      end up sending us something truly awful.
 Tom: Hey, maybe she'll start sending us episodes of 
      that new Trek show.
Mike: [pause] Nah. I don't think she's that evil. 
      Maybe she'll send up something with Carrot...

[Suddenly, the Bridge is rocked by explosions, causing 
 Cambot to lurch from side to side. The trio steadies
 themselves against the console.]
Crow: What the?
 Tom: We're under attack!
Mike: Tom, if you've annoyed those dolphins again...
 Tom: I haven't! I swear!
[Gypsy rushed in frantically.]

Gypsy: Mike! Something's coming in on the Hexfield!

[The hexfield open to reveal a rather peeved Benjamin
 Sisko. Behind him is Deep Space Nine's Ops.]

 All: Uh-oh.

Mike: Hi there, Admiral Sisko, sir. How are you today?

Sisko: [coldly] Oh, Admiral Sisko, sir, is it? I seem
      to recall just a few minutes ago someone 
      referring to me as "baldy". 

Crow: That was a joke, your Emmisaryness, sir.

Sisko: [coldy, but escalating in fury] Just like all
      of those Hawk references were? Or am I still
      Admiral Easy Reader? A cross between David 
      Koresh and Captain Hazelwood? A second
      rate rip-off of Jean Luc Picard?!?

 Tom: Heh. We meant all of those in the nicest 
      possible way...

Sisko: [politely] Oh, I'm sure that you did. Just
      as I mean firing these 1000 photon torpedoes
      at your vessel in the nicest possible way.

Mike: You're not going to arm the warheads
      again, right?

Sisko: [Grinning evilly] I never repeat the same
       trick twice. Fire. Helm, let's get the
       hell out of here.

[The hexfield closes.]
Mike: Well, so this is it. We're all going to die.
[Silence. The four shift about uncomfortably.]
Magic Voice: Guys? I know I haven't said much lately,
      but I just thought that if we're all going to
      die, then I should probably get a last few
      seconds of screen time. So, how about them 
      Lakers?
Gypsy: o/~ When you walk through a storm, hold your
       head up high... o/~
Crow: Tom? I just thought that I'd tell you that
      after all these years together, I really,
      really hate you.
 Tom: Me too, Crow.
[Suddenly, the ship lurches from side to side... No,
 wait. It's just Cambot lurching. The rest of the
 crew looks confused.]
Mike: Wait a sec! The torpedoes all just exploded!
      We're safe!
Magic Voice: But how?
Gypsy: o/~ You'll never walk a-lone!!! o/~

[The hexfield opens to reveal...]

 All: Cats?!?

[Yes, it's the villainous baddie from Zero Wing,
 a.k.a. the "All your base are belong to us" game.]

Cats: Oho. I yes I is.

Mike: Wow! Hey, thanks for saving us...

Cats: Silence. You have no chance to survive make
      your time. Soon, all your base are belong
      to us!

[The Hexfield closes. The bots are laughing
 hysterically.]

Mike: Great. Two death threats in one... what
      are you two laughing at?
 Tom: That was great! [snicker]
Crow: All your base. [snicker]
Mike: You told me that wasn't funny!
Crow: Well, it is when *he* says it!

Gypsy: Mike! Cats' ships are being driven off!

[The hexfield opens again. It's Krankor.]

 All: Krankor!

[Yes, Krankor.]

Krankor: Greetings, Mike. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

 All: Hi Krankor.

Krankor: Have you begun to quiver in fear yet from 
      my sudden arrival, Mike?

Mike: Not really.

Krankor: Of course you are! For soon my forces shall
         sweep across the entire globe! The Earth 
         shall be under my grasp! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Crow: Yep.
 Tom: We know.
Mike: We're deeply afraid. Really we are.

Krankor: Yes, for you have tasted the wrath if 
         Krankor! Ha-ha...

[Suddenly, Krankor's bridge is buffeted by explosions.]
Krankor: Ahhhh! Raise shields! We'll discuss this later,
       Nelson!

[The hexfield closes, but as it closes, we hear...]

Voice: [V.O.] SPAAAAACE GHOOOOST!

Gypsy: Mike, scanners indicate 45 vessels engaged in 
       battle in our immediate vicinity!

Mike: Great. Well guys, it's going to take a while
      for them to determine who gets to kill us.
      You want to tell them how they can become
      targets too?
Crow: Sure. To join the MiSTing Authors Dibs List, 
      send an e-mail to "majordomo@pinky.wtower.com"
      with the message "subscribe dibslist" in the
      message body. Don't forget to read the FAQ at
      "http://www.masemware.com/mst3k/faq.shtml", 
      don't work blue, and for Pete's sake, don't
      feed fanfic authors after midnight!
 Tom: Why?
Crow: I dunno. I guess they get all worked up and 
      can't get back to sleep.
 Tom: Oh.
Mike: [looking out the hexfield] Hey, is that
      the White Star?
Crow: No, I think that's the Heart of Gold.
Mike: Ah.
[They all stare out the hexfield for a moment.
 The Castle Forrester light begins to flash.]
Mike: Ah. Pearl's calling. Hey, you enjoying 
      the light show up here?

[Castle Forrester]
[Off in the background, Bobo is still trapped in
 one of the file drawers.]
Pearl: Yeah, yeah. It's all very pretty. But they
       better not make me lose my security deposit
       on that sat...
Observer: Yo, Pearl. Look at this.
[Pearl glances at the screen.]
Pearl: Hey. Look at this. Those folks on the internet
       are already writing stories about all those
       folks shooting at you.
Bobo: [weakly] Lawgiver?
Pearl: Not now, Bobo. Hey, some of these are pretty
       good, by which I mean they're horrible. But
       they'll be great to inflict on you. Later,
       Mike.

[The scene returns to the SoL. Gypsy has left the
 bridge.]
Mike: Great. Not only are we being shot at, but 
      Pearl's got all sorts of new material to
      use too.
Crow: Well, we have to figure out some way to
      get rid of those ships before they do 
      something we regret. Like kill us.
 Tom: Hmm. Could we take the fighters and
      engage in a desperate dogfight with 
      the other ships?
Mike: Sure, if we had any fighters.
Crow: Should I power up the main photon cannons?
Mike: I don't think our headlights would do
      anything to them.
 Tom: Can we let Mike wander aimlessly around 
      the bridge, hoping that he'll somehow blow 
      up the combatants?
Mike: Hey!
Crow: Nah. He'd probably accidentally destroy the
      Earth too, and then where would we get our
      cable from?
 Tom: Oh, yeah.
Mike: Guys, I do not blow up that many...
[Gypsy suddenly reappears wearing a large blonde 
 wig.]
Gypsy: All right, you space maggots! Listen up!
       This satellite is under my protection, and
       unless you want to deal with me, you'll get 
       the heck outta here! Or else I might have 
       to start carving things into hulls...
[Outside, the ships rapidly scatter in all directions.
 Moments later, the nearby space is clear.]
Crow: Wow!
 Tom: Great job, Gypsy!
Mike: Yeah, that was a great impression of Marrissa!
Gypsy: Who's Marrissa?
[Gypsy exits. The three other crew members stare
 blankly as she exits.]
Crow: She's scaring me, Mike.
Mike: Ah, I wouldn't worry about it. Hey, the
      starships are gone! That's good!
 Tom: Yep.
Crow: I guess. Still, I keep thinking we're
      forgetting something.
Mike: I'm sure it's nothing. [to the camera]
      Goodnight everyone.

[Mike hits the button, and the screen contracts 
 with a ...]

Ratliff: [V.O.] Hey guys! I thought up a new story
         while I was locked away. It's about
         Marrissa being locked up in a women's 
         prison...
Crow: [V.O.] Oh, now I remember!
Mike: [V.O.] Why me?
