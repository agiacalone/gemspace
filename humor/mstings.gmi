# Usenet MSTings
A collection of humor in the form of "MSTings", an early 1990s text-based poking fun of poorly-written fanfic. Most of these appeared in alt.tv.mst3k and rec.arts.tv.mst3k on Usenet. I loved these back in the day, and they still remain some of my favorite early Internet satire. Get ready for some cringe!

In tribute to one of the oldest, bloodiest flame-wars on the Internet: Joel > Mike.
