Gopher | Gopher & GopherSpace
-----------------------------

"Gopher" - in this case - is a network protocol and distributed
document delivery system which uses a universal file hierarchy that
transcends system architectures to serve files and documents.

A "network protocol" is a set of instructions by which one computer
communicates with other computers on a network. The computer in
which a Gopher resides communicates with other networked computers
so the Gopher can deliver files and documents to them.

Gopher is also an online "space" that is free of advertising and
commercialism. Because it doesn't display images, support Java or
Javascript, Gopher space is a poor choice for those who want to
advertise, commercialize or monetize the Internet.

Gopher just may be the last commercial-free space on the Internet.
