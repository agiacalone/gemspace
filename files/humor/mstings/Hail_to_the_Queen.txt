[Note: This takes place just after Episode 822: "Overdrawn at 
the Memory Bank"]

[Season 8 Opening.] 

[The Bridge of the Satellite of Love is a mess.  There are 
streamers hung one the walls and balloons are scattered about 
the Bridge. Confetti is everywhere. On the far wall is a banner 
proclaiming "Wrap Party!" Mike walks in and is startled to see 
that Cambot is active.]

Mike: Oh, hi everyone.  I'm Mike Nelson, and welcome to the 
      Satellite of Love. Pearl threw a party for us last night 
      after her successful beg-a-thon, and I'm afraid that 
      we're still not quite up to speed today. And I'm pretty 
      sure that Pearl doesn't have anything else to show  us 
      for another few months, but you're welcome to hang around 
      if you'd like.
[Tom walks on screen, humming a tune.]
Tom: Hi Mike.  Have you seen the coffee? 
Mike: The  hazelnut, the Brazilian, the Vanilla, or the 
      Mochachino strawberry surprise?
Tom: The motoroil flavored. [Tom walks offscreen.]
Mike:  It's in the cupboard by the box of Yummy Mummy.
Tom: [Off screen] Found it! 
[Appearing on screen again with a cup of coffee.] 
     Say, what's Cambot doing on?
Mike: He was on when I came in. Maybe we're doing another 
      special.
Tom: Another "Little Gold Statue" maybe?	
Mike: [Shrugs] Could be.

[Crow walks onscreen. He's wearing an ascot, and a monocle and 
he's smoking a cigarette through a long cigarette holder.]
Crow: [Speaking in a fake uppercrust English Accent.] Top of 
      the morning to you chaps. Smashing party last night. Why, 
      who would have ever thought that Pearl was such a 
      talented dancer? And those blasted Mole Men kept droning 
      on and on and on and on. . .
Mike: Crow, we're on.
Crow: I beg your pardon? Michael, whatever do you mean that 
      we're. . .  [He turns to Cambot.] Yikes! [Normal voice] 
      Oh, hi everyone! Um, Breasts?
Tom: Busted.
Crow: Knock it off Tom! I'm, uh, getting  into character for my 
      one man play celebrating the life of Noel Coward.
Tom: Suuuure Crow.
Crow: That's it! You're going down Gumball boy!
Mike: Hold it guys. I think an explanation is here. [He hits 
      the light.] Hello?

[The Studio]
[The scene shifts to the studio where Pearl held her fund-
raiser.  Pearl stands uneasily in the middle of the floor, 
while Bobo ,The Observer, and Ortega stand in the background 
looking very glum.]
Pearl: [Monotone] Good Morning fellow employee of  Amalgamated 
       Diversified Compudyne Research, Entertainment and Pets. 
       And how are you today?

[SoL]
Mike: Pearl, are you okay?

[Studio]
Pearl: Of course, fellow employee. All is well here today. How  
       is productivity in your area?

[SoL]
Mike: We don't have any products, Pearl.
Tom: Well, I've been selling Magic cards over the Internet. 
     Does that count?
Mike: No, Tom. What's going on?

[Studio]
Pearl: [Normal voice] All right, I'll come clean. After Clayton 
       became a space baby, I sold Deep 13 to some investors to 
       earn money to find you. Well, they're still around, and 
       it turns out that they own the satellite, the studio, 
       and even the Widowmaker, lock, stock and barrel. And 
       they're not too pleased with our ratings.
[A middle aged man clad in a yellow and black checkered 
sportscoat appears next to Pearl, flanked by what looks to be a 
stagehand.]
Herb: Hello, Mr. Nelson. Love your work. It's really funny 
      stuff. However...

[SoL]
Mike:  Hold it. What do you mean? This isn't a show! I'm 
       trapped up here on a satellite and they've been 
       torturing me by showing me bad movies! It's not a show!

[Studio]
Pearl: Actually Mike, Clayton put a video camera on board and 
       sold tapes of the experiments to his fellow scientists 
       when money ran low. Then Frank would squander the money 
       on duct tape. [mumbling] That little weasel. [normal  
       voice] So, there is a show.
Herb: Anyway, it's really funny stuff. But, we're having 
      problems with the show's  demographics. You're not 
      pulling in the male 18-30 year olds. So, we're going to 
      have to  replace one of you with a new character.

[SoL]
[All aboard are visibly nervous.]
Mike: Replace one of us? Who?

[Studio]
Herb: That purple one, Gypsum. 

[SoL]
[Gypsy pushes past Mike]
Gypsy: What?!

[Studio]
Herb: [shrugging] The kids just don't understand her. Besides, 
      we need some sex appeal for the  show, so we've arranged 
      for you to gain a new companion.

[SoL]
Gypsy: I'm not going anywhere! I run this satellite! Everyone 
       aboard will die without me being  here! Besides, I've 
       got a contract! Where's my agent?!
[Curtis, the stagehand,  appears from off screen.]
Curtis: Come on. Your contract's been picked up by  "Jenny."
Gypsy: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[Gypsy and Curtis disappear off stage.]
Crow: Well that sucks.
Tom:  Hey, we won't work without Gypsy here! We can just wait 
      this out until she's back here. Well, Mike will die of 
      asphyxiation in a few hours, but we can wait forever!
[Mike visibly pales.]

[Studio]
Herb: Relax guys. The ship's functions will be taken over by 
      some good Unionized  help. We'll  have her replacement 
      there in a little while.
Pearl: By the way, to celebrate your new shipmate, we've got a 
       special piece of work for you today. It's a piece of 
       fan-fiction.

[SoL]
Tom: Uh-oh.
Mike: Stephen Ratliff didn't write this by any chance?

[Studio]
Pearl: No, no.

[SoL]
Mike: Whew.
Crow: Thank goodness.

[Studio]
Pearl: It's called "Hail to the Queen" by Rob Tounts, and it's 
       actually a fan-fic of a popular series of fan-fiction 
       stories. [She grins evilly] The Marrissa Stories to be 
       precise. Enjoy, Michael.

[SoL]
Crow: Marrissa fan-fic fan-fic?
Tom: Oh look, that seventh seal is being broken.
[The lights begin to flash.]
Mike: Too late guys. We've got Marrissa sign!

[The bots race around while Mike hits the lights. The door 
sequence begins.]

      until Rick Berman runs it into the ground!"

>                              Hail to the Queen

Tom: The Queen Latifah Story!
Mike: The Freddie Mercury Story!
Crow: The Majel Barrett Story!

Crow: I bet she can't sing "Fat Bottom Girls" as good as 
      Freddie.

Tom: Didn't the header say that his name was Ron?
Mike: Tom, he knows what his own name is. I hope.

>Disclaimer: 

Mike: Gene Roddenberry should not take the blame for this.

Crow: I hear that was going to be the new disclaimer on the 
      McDonald's coffee cups, only with "coffee" instead of 
      "story".

Crow: You and me both, pal.

Crow: Er, does he know he used a capital 'F'?
Tom: Maybe it IS the Freddie Mercury story!
Mike: Uh...oh.  Should we be riffing on a story by a made guy?

>  and Stephen Ratliff  (the inspiration for the story) 

[All visibly shiver]
Tom: Shouldn't Satan be on that list too?

>           This story is set shortly after the Marrissa story 
>Return to Glory.  I'm afraid it isn't out yet, but should be 
>one day. 

[All scream]
Mike: Oh, what I wouldn't give for a good cancel-bot about 
      now....
Crow: Actually, it takes a little bit of chutzpah to write a 
      sequel to a  story that hasn't happened yet
Tom: Especially a Marrissa story! [shudders]

All: Uh-oh.
Mike: This is bad.

Crow: Oh, probably a group of unclean, unshaven college 
      students hovering about a computer in the basement of 
      some dorm somewhere.

>                                           this is NOT a

Tom: Uh-hum.
Mike: What's MiST? That prequel to Riven?
Tom: We'll tell you later.

      strength if you don't eat?!?


>                                  Prologue
>

Tom: It was a time of war, it was a time of peace...

>Time:  Shortly after Star Trek: First Contact 
>

Tom: Riker has been placed in command of the next half-dozen 
     sequels, Data has been possessed by the katra of John 
     Adams, and Lily has escaped to HBO and collected several 
     CableACE awards.
Mike: Nice to know *someone* besides Larry Sanders is!
Crow: Bitter much, Mike?
Mike: Oh, just a tad.

> The scream was heard across the galaxy by the Collective. 

Crow: Somewhere, one of the Borg had assimilated the complete 
      works of Pauly Shore.

>                                                          It 
>knew at once, their Queen was dead.  

Mike: There would be no more Bohemian Rhapsody any more.
Crow: Okay, enough Queen riffs. Agreed?
Mike: Okay.
Tom: Well, I guess. But I had a great riff using "Another One 
     Bites the Dust" planned.

>                                   The race known across the 
>galaxy as the Borg 

Mike: I'm sensing a strong "across the galaxy" motif here."

>                    was thrown into chaos in the span of ten 
>minutes.  

Mike: There's an implant sale at Bloomingdales!

>          This turmoil was started by the only race to repel 
>the Borg to this point, the Humans.  

Mike: [pointing to his left] First the Tholians repelled them 
      to that point...
      [pointing to his right] then the Ferengi repelled them to 
      that point...
      [pointing straight ahead, at the Borg] and now the Humans 
      have repelled them to *this* point.  Any questions?
Crow: Just forget the sacrifice of Vulcans, Betazoids, and 
      other members of the Federation.
Tom: Oh, yeah, those Humans are sooooo great . . . oh, sorry 
     Mike.
Mike: Don't worry about it.

>                                    More specifically, Jean-
>Luc Picard/ Locutus was the one who had removed the Queen from 
>her hive.  

Tom: Wearing a black veil and spraying in a lot of smoke first,  
     I'd guess.

>         The Borg could sustain itself until a new queen was 
>created, but the process took time. 

Crow: There were forms to fill out, and the Borg HR department  
      had budget cutbacks.

>There was only one quick, easy solution,

Tom: They would have to go to Queens.

>                                         assimilation.

Crow: Isn't that Microsoft's job?
Tom: Geez, that's the Borg's answer to everything!
Mike: Well, you have to admit it did work up to now.

>                                                      Using 
>the all encompassing  knowledge of the race, the Collective 
>searched through records regarding races from  Earth, the 
>Delta Quadrant, and anywhere in between. 

Crow: Results: "assimilation," 41511 hits; "Federation," 613351 
      hits; "Marina Sirtis+nude OR naked," 31515782 hits.

>                                         The whole process 
>took a mere hour, 

Mike: And 45 minutes of that was just trying to connect onto 
      "Borg On-Line."

>           when a candidate was found. 

Tom: But before that, the Borg would be forced to endure ten 
     months of campaigning.

> The irony, the gains, the sheer power that could be gained 
>from the assimilation of this one human. 

Tom: Anyone else getting a cold, queasy lump right in the 
     middle of your stomach?
Mike & Crow: Yes.

>                                         The target was 
>selected, and seven functional Borg cube ships moved towards 
>it. 

Tom: Yeah, FULLY-functional Borg cubes, if you know what I 
     mean!
Mike: Tom is there NOTHING you can't make sound dirty?
Tom: Only 672 things.
Mike: I'd say you're being anal but you'd probably make that 
      sound dirty too.

Mike: Call me Ishmael Amber Flores Picard. . .

Crow: Not the most exciting sequel ever made, since everyone 
      died at the end of "Glory," but the studio insisted.

>             Cruising along the former Romulan Neutral Zone,

Mike: So they had their brights on, and they accidentally 
      blinded the planet of Argus V.

All: o/~ We've got a great big convoy, traveling through 
     the night... o/~
Mike: Hey, wait a minute! This is the plot for 'Battlestar 
      Galactica!'
Tom: Great, now we remember Battlestar Galactica! We could have 
     used those riffs in 'Space Mutiny!'

>                                                        The

>imaginable.  

Mike: It took them 5 tries to get it, but, mind you, it was 
      top-of-the-line!
Crow: Scrimshaw?
Mike: Yep.
Tom: Web page design?
Mike: Yep.
Crow: Slugging averages?
Mike: Yep.
Tom: Singing the blues?
Mike: Yep.

>           The ship was undeniably effective in both war and 
>peace time.

Crow: Since the latter only lasted about five minutes when it 
      was around, no one was truly sure.

>           Systems on board were like muscles of a finely

Crow: They were filled with steroids.

>           In comfort, the mile-long craft was unsurpassed.  

Tom: I have this horrible, horrible feeling that any second 
     now, Richard Simmons and Kathie Lee Gifford are going to 
     show up.

Mike: The Enterprise has a SOUNDTRACK?  Of the Ocean?
Tom: After all these years, that Celine Dion song is *still* 
     on top of the charts?!
All: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tom: The entire ship is coated in silky blankets?

      intensive violence.

Tom: No, Mike, even Ratliff cannot control the force that *is* 
     Marrissa anymore.

>                     Sarah Alara Picard, her baby girl.

Tom: First name after Fergie, middle name after the elf NPC 
     Stephen had a crush on in his junior high D&D campaign.
Crow: I notice the kid doesn't get Jay's last name.
Mike: Are you really surprised?
Crow: Well, no.


>     The crib was set up as a partial bio-bed that allowed the 
>parent to discern  why the baby was malcontent. 

Tom: Specifically, it emitted a high-pitched "WHAAAAAAAH!!" 
     noise.
Mike: "Malcontent?" So she's unhappy with the Federation 
      government?
Crow: Don't forget, Lwaxanna Troi's running it now.

>                                              This particular

Tom: This is the *LAST* thing I needed to see!
Mike: I think I'm going to be sick!!
Crow: Should I go get the milk of magnesium ?
Tom: AARRRRGGGGH!!!!

Crow: The terminal is holding the child, and Marrissa is 
      nursing it but she has to walk over to it?  Either that 
      kid has long lips, or...
Mike: For the love of Pete, stop right there.

>                                       and answered the call. 

Mike: If she left the video on, someone's gonna get a surprise.
Crow: Let's hope that's not Cal on the screen, else, calcium.
Tom & Mike: ARRRRRRGHHHHHHH!!!!

> "Attention all starships.",  

Mike: [Picard] I regret to report--YAUUGH!! Marrissa, for God's 
      sake, cover yourself!

>                            Fleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard's

Crow: I mean, it's not like I'm milking this for all it's 
      worth...
[Tom is visibly shivering on his seat]
Mike: Crow, that's enough for now...

>                                 "A colony on the outskirts of 
>the Federation was destroyed this morning.  

Crow: Suddenly, a bare chested Riker pops up besides Picard, 
      with "Soy Bomb"  painted on his pallid, doughy torso, 
      and begins  gyrating suggestively.
Mike: Well, thanks for permanently putting me off my feed,  
      Crow.
Crow: Any time, Mike.


>                                            All indications

Mike: Since there aren't any other known murderous simple 
      geometric shapes.
Crow: Plus they spray painted "Borg Roolz!" on the colony 
      walls.

Crow: No ship, no space suit, no nothin' - just Jean-Luc and a

Mike: [Picard] I have just been handed a correction.  I will 
      lead the assault with the aid of a starship and fifteen 
      hundred crewmen.

Mike: Too bad the Romulans didn't have access to "Voyager

Crow: Yeah, then they'd be up to their prominent eyebrows in 
      warbirds!

>         Having the Warbirds allowed as home defence, resulted

Crow: So there's a five-day waiting period before buying a 
      warbird now?
Mike: Remember, when warbirds are outlawed, only outlaws will 
      have warbirds!
Tom: [Charlton Heston] Join the National Warbird Association 
     today.

Tom: SoongCorp, when you need a new species overnight.

Crow: [James Doohan] I'm Commander Scott, of the Fixing Stuff

Tom: [Picard] I agree you should be free to pursue your dreams,    
     Data, but is "Second star to the left and straight on 'til 
     morning" really practical?

Mike: Yet all his attempts on Marrissa's life had failed.

Mike: So a third of the technology is based on an unsuccessful 
      model, while another third is based on a murderously 
      psychopathic model?
Tom: If I didn't know better, I'd think Data was suffering 
     aftereffects of Ratliff Gas exposure.

Tom: I seem to remember them rejecting the idea of a whole race

Crow: Something I heartily agree with, by the way...*Mike*.
Mike: Well, invent a self-cleaning load pan bay and we'll talk.

[pause]
Tom: No slamming old sleepy eyes, Mike.
Mike: Oh. Sorry.
Crow: She's gone! And we'll never see her again! 
      WAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Mike: There, there. I'm sure that we'll see her everytime 
      "Jenny" comes on.
Tom: So, we might see her two or three times again?

Crow: Apparently so, Mike. But most of the Bridge crew had 
      filled the compartments underneath with liquor.

Mike: *Angry* phaser beams?  
Tom: Sure, Mike!  And happy phaser beams are the ones that will 
     give you a back rub and a soothing foot massage before 
     they vaporize you.

Crow: What's with all the insect references? 
Mike: [giggling] If I could, I'd just squash this fanfic flat.
Tom: [giggling as well] I'm just bugged out by the whole thing.
Crow: Ha-ha, very funny.

Tom: [as Borg] You will like Kenny G.  Resistance is futile!

Mike: And with all the electronic equipment knocked out, the 
      entire Romulan Empire was left without access to reruns   
      of CBS's Friday night Block Party.

Crow: Wow.  The action.
Mike: The tension.
Tom: The brevity.

>                   Their business with Romulus complete, the

Mike: Er, haven't the Borg assimilated all sorts of stuff  
      anyway?  I mean, you think they'd have a Cloak.
Crow: Maybe they needed to assimilate the "ON" switch.
Tom: Y'know, if they'd just thought to bring two more ships, 
     they could merge into one real big cube.

Mike: Well, that does describe dull and uneventful rather well.

Mike: Well, sleepin' with Marrissa'll do that to a guy.
Crow: If he looks like that, he should LEAVE the bar.

Crow: 50% caffeine?  Why not just ask for a bag of crack and 
      some crystal meth and be done with it?
Tom: Unfortunately he forgot to specify "hot" so it'll come 
     out all lukewarm and stuff.

Crow: [Marrissa] Sarah, this is what Earth looks like on the

Mike: Yes, using a very, very, very, very, broad definition

[All smirk and giggle]
Tom: That's quite an understatement there, Martin.

Mike: Not a word, Crow.
Crow: What?

>       "Shut the heck up!"  Martin interrupted,

[All cheer]
Mike: Oh wow. That was fun. I can see why Marrissa likes doing 
      that. Let me try some more. Sit up straight! Clean the 
      room before I get home! Fix me Dinner!
Crow: Mike. . . .
Mike: Turn off that stupid holodeck! Watch the kid while I go 
      out with Clara!
Tom: Mike. . .

Tom: [To Crow] We need to up his dosage again.
Crow: [To Tom] Agreed.

>but I don't need to hear that, 

Tom: Neither did we!!!
Mike: This story is just probing the dark steamy underside of 
      the Marrissa universe that we never wanted to see!
Crow: We'll probably learn about Marrissa's hot flashes 
      next....
Tom & Mike: AIE!!

>                             it's a little too personal.

Tom: And this is the ship's *counselor*?!?
Mike: Yeah, and the ship's doctor doesn't like to do invasive  
      surgery, it's too icky.

Mike: [Martin] When I snap my fingers, you will wake up and 
      have a backbone. Three...two...[snap]
Crow: [Jay] YES!  I WILL THINK FOR MYSELF!  What next, Martin?

Tom: [As Jay] Maybe Marrissa WAS Bigfoot...

>            maybe they got married too young.  

Mike: Again, that's quite an understatement.
Crow: Keep this up, and the Marrissa line is going to be 
      retiring before they're 8.
Tom: Theirs Was A Love That Spanned The Stars, But Society Said 
     They Were Too Young.  Read "Jay And Marrissa: Thank You, 
     Ma'am, May I Have Another?" in "Dark Mansion of Forbidden 
     Love" from DC Comics.

Mike: [Jay] No, wait, that's not love.  Ewww...
Crow: It's the Loooooooove Boat, the Next Generation!

Tom: [Jay] 1800 hours: Have dinner.  1900 hours: Argue with

     asleep.

Mike: Jay's  finally sorted out the difference between love 
      and lust and fear.

Mike: [panting] Come on, guys, we can do this!  It's not like 
      we've never seen this before...
Tom: Actually, Mike, this is our first time.
Mike: Oh. Then prepare for EXTREME PAIN!
All: [scream again]

Mike: Fortunately, Jay was used to this.

Mike: What? Like it was *his* turn to feed Sarah?!

>      I need my beauty sleep." Said Marrissa.  Jay couldn't 
>help but remember a joke involving an old childhood story 
>about Rip Van Winkle. 

Tom: Sooooo, apparently, if Marrissa sleeps too long, she 
     becomes a 70 year old man with a long white beard?
Crow: Hey, Jay! Get the sleeping gas now while you have time!

>      "Besides, you know our poor wittle babykins can't get to

Crow: If Jay strangled her right now, there's not a jury in the 
      galaxy that would convict him.

>Heart', I doubt I'll ever understand." continued Marrissa. 

[appalled silence]
Crow: That sound you just heard? Everything good & decent in 
      the universe dying.
Tom: Yep - joy, laughter, kindness, warmth - all gone!
Mike: Man, I *hate* when that happens.

Mike: Jay, return your manhood to it's previous position.

Mike: [Jay] "Power Rangers", "Space Cases", "Saved by the Bell" 
      - there's *got* to be another series I can sneak into!
Crow: You know, this really is a shocking and unsettling turn.
Tom: I know.  I appreciated it when Jay was so P-whipped you 
     could use him as a harem guard.

Mike: Which would have promptly caused the Enterprise to 
      implode, and ended this little  fanfic.

Crow: Only in an airlock.

Crow: Let's hope that doesn't include Sarah's diaper duty.
Tom & Mike: Ewwwww!

Crow: MAKEUP!  Could we have some more pancake on Marrissa?  
      We're still getting a terrible glare off her.

>             burying into his back.   

Mike: Yep, the marriage has NO effect on the efficiency of the 
      command structure whatsoever.

>                                   He was almost happy when

Mike: [as Helmsman] Oh, wait, sorry, just a sensor blurp.  
      Something didn't happen.
Tom: [as Jay] Oh, damn!

>                                       The feeling dropped

      opponent's  resources than just destroy them?
Crow: Well, unlike you, the Borg didn't learn everything they 
      know about tactics by playing "The Ancient Art of War."

Tom: Another Borg grabbed the rifle and shot Alex.  Patterson 
     grabbed the rifle and killed the Borg.  A third drone 
     grabbed the rifle and killed Patterson. Jay grabbed the 
     rifle...
Mike: Thank you, Thomas Malory.

Mike: Thus Marrissa achieves empathy with her audience.

Crow: Pumping Iron?
Tom: Twins?
Mike: Jingle all the Way?

Tom: [Ahnuld] It's not a too-mah!

>          "Everybody Down!!!!" at the top of her lungs.  

Tom: Yep, all that Starfleet training and she turns to 
     Schwarzenegger for inspiration.

[All laugh hysterically.]
Mike: If I spin fast enough they can't hit me!
Crow: Oh, sure, Starfleet won't mind the ring of burn marks in 
              the walls around the bridge.
Tom: I won't bother adapting to her frequency, she couldn't hit 
     a Horta at this dist--
Mike: This is the weirdest and most violent version of Swan  
      Lake I've ever seen!
Crow: If I cover my head you can't see me!
Tom: Sylvester Stallone *IS* Tara Lipinski in "Rambo IV: Death 
     Lutz"!

>        The crew was safely on the deck, under the wave of

Mike: Which was a welcome change.

Crow: And Marrissa mixed with 20th Century ideas save the day!

Tom: Covering a psychic Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.

Mike: That's our Marrissa!

Mike: Courtney Love, no!

Tom: Her worst dreams had come true. The Borg had assimilated 
     Linus.

>                                    the blanket was Sarah's.  
>Rage swelled up inside her like a over-shaken pop bottle. 

Mike: I hope that she hasn't had any Pop Rocks.

Mike: Anyone feel like a game of chess, all of a sudden?

All: EWW-W-W-W-W!!!

>    leaving only a sea of relief.  

Crow: What's with all the water references?
Mike: Urrr, I shouldn't have had that Big Gulp before we came 
      in the theater...
Tom: Once her child was assimilated she could kill her and 
     finally get some sleep at night.

>                                The choice seemed fare to her,

Tom: Homophones: Your Guide To Quality Fanfics.

>                                                                             
the drones life for her childs, a diplomatic trade off. 

Mike: 'Course, it doesn't take nine months to make a new drone.

>  Resigned, Marrissa lowered her rifle, and Jay remained on 
>the  deck in shock. 

Crow: Pretty much Jay's usual bridge station.

>            A cry of warning came from Jay's lips as another 
>Borg appeared behind Marrissa.  But it was too late. 

Crow: Galaxy threatened, Federation in danger, Marrissa lets 
      her personal life interfere.

>          As Marrissa whipped around, 

Tom: o/~ Whip it! Whip it good! o/~

>                                     the Borg extended the

[Suddenly, balloons and confetti fall from the theater ceiling, 
and Mike and the bots dance around cheering]


>                    This wasn't right, 

Crow: Sez you!

>                                      Marrissa's mind screamed 
>out.  

Crow: Her first thought as the Borg, and it's the most sensible 
      thought she's had!

>    A cheap shot, a low blow, 

Mike: Poetic justice...

>                            call it what you will,

Crow: How about "Eunice?"

>but the Borg had pulled it.

Tom: Pull the other one, it's got bells on.

>                           The nanoprobes assimilated the 
>blood cells one by one, and the rest of her body couldn't take 
>the stress, and shut itself off.

Crow: The nanites considered this "slumming"
Tom: Mike, is it OK to be enjoying this so much?  Shouldn't I 
     feel guilty, or pity, or something?
Mike: Nah.  She's had this coming for YEARS.

>       Collapsing to the floor, the bridge crew stared in 
>shock at the image of their fallen leader.  

Mike: Then spontaneous cheers erupted throughout the ship!
Crow: The Federation declared a galaxy-wide day of celebration!
Tom: And cards of condolence poured into the Borg.
Mike: [Alexander] Dibs on her bike.

>           The female Borg lowered Sarah to a now vacant seat, 
>then assisted the other Borg in lifting Marrissa.  

Crow: "Lifting Marrissa" - the new sequel to "Raising Arizona"

>                                                  The three

Mike: Cheez-Whiz.  Crates of it.

Crow: I think the Borg HR department is gonna catch a lot of 
      flack for this.
Mike:  So now Ru Paul's messed up in this?
Tom: Let's go.
[They file out of the theater.]

[1. . . 2 . . . 3. . . 4 . . . 5. . . 6 . . .]

[Mike, Tom, and Crow stand behind the control console. All 
three look rather glum. Stereotypical movie crew union people 
drinking coffee and eating danishes lounge around the trio.]

Mike: [Sigh] Things just aren't the same up here without Gypsy.
Crow: [Sigh] Yeah, the bridge seems more crowded somehow.
Tom:[Sputtering] Of course it's more crowded! We're surrounded 
    by union  thugs!
Shop Steward:  Hey, our contract specifically states that we 
       are to be referred to as "union hooligans" not thugs.
Mike: Whatever.
Tom: Where did those danishes come from?
Shop Steward: Catered. We'd offer you one, but only dues paying 
              members get them.
Crow: Blast.
Mike: Look, this is silly. I'm going to call Herb and see if we 
      can get Gypsy back here.
[Mike hits the view screen button.]
Mike: Hey Herb! Herb!

[Studio]
[Herb is reading some papers. Pearl is nowhere to be seen.]
Herb: Oh, hi Mike. I was looking through your Arbitron numbers. 
      They've been pretty good.

[SoL]
Mike: Yeah, that's great Herb. . .
[Crow darts in front of Mike.]
Crow: What's our share?
[Mike pushes Crow aside.]
Mike: Look, we don't want these union guys aboard. [Turns] No 
      offense guys.
Shop Steward: None taken.
Mike: We just want Gypsy back. Send her back up, okay?

[Studio]
Herb: No can do, Mikey. She's already working on "Jenny" as 
      Jenny's wacky neighbor. Anyway, I've come up with an even 
      better companion for you. She's on her way now.

[SoL]
Tom: We don't want a better companion! We want Gypsy!
Crow: Well, let's not be hasty here. . .

[Studio]
Herb: Whoops. Gotta run. I'm doing lunch with Kevin Bacon.  You 
      can thank me later. Toodles Mike.

[SoL]
Mike: Great.
Crow: This sucks.
Tom: Well, let's just make the best of this then. I'm going to 
     get one of those danish. . .

[Suddenly, the Satellite is rocked, Star Trek style, by 
explosions. The union crew scatters.]
Tom: What the?
Crow: It's not me!  I'm not scheduled to buffet the ship with 
      explosions  for another few days!
Mike: Cambot! Give me rocket #9!

[The scene shifts to the outside of the Satellite of Love. A 
Borg Cube is hanging, motionless, just outside the SoL. It 
appears to be firing on the SoL.]

Crow: Mike! It's the Borg! They're out to get us!
[A transporter effect begins behind the trio. A humanoid figure 
begins to materialize.]
Tom: Look! They're sending a boarding crew aboard! You've got 
     to stop  them, Mike!
Mike: We have no weapons! What do you want me to do? Wave my 
      hand and say "Borg begone now!"
[Mike waves one of his hands and places the other on the 
control console. Suddenly, the scene shifts outside. The Borg 
cube is struck by a massive bolt of energy. The cube then 
explodes in a gigantic fireball, which is sure to have used up 
all of the special effect money for season 9 and 10.]
[Back on the Bridge, Tom and Crow stare at Mike, who stands 
there sheepishly.]
Tom: Mike Nelson, Destroyer of Worlds strikes again.
Crow: We stand humbled in your presence, Oh Mighty One!
Mike: Knock it off you two. I'm sure that there's some rational 
      explanation for this.
[Mike begins to examine the console. Meanwhile, the humanoid 
figure behind Mike finishes materializing. It's a Borg. A 
female Borg, who begins to walk intently towards Mike and the 
bots, who are unaware of her presence.]
Mike: [Staring at the console] Look! The nanites added an 
      "Anti-Borg ray" to the control console when we weren't 
      looking. Say, there's an "Anti- Shadows " ray too. And an 
      "Anti-Team Knight Rider" ray . . .
[The Borg drone is now mere feet away from the trio, who now 
look up and see her.]
Tom: AHHHH!
Crow: Hey look! A Borg boarding party! You don't see many of 
      those around here.
Mike: [Hesitantly] What do you want?
Borg: We. Can. No. Longer. Hear. The. Collective.  What. Has. 
      Been. Done?
Mike: Well, uh, I. . .
Tom: Mike blew up your pathetic little cube!
Crow: Yeah! So back of unless you want the same done to you, 
      pal!
Mike: Guys, stop helping.
Borg: The Collective is no more? We are alone? Without our 
      crewmates to assist us? This unit must continue its 
      existence.  This unit must adapt. . . 
[The Borg wanders off stage.]
Crow: Mike!. You scared her off ! Way to go!
Tom: Yeah, good job Big Guy!
Mike: But I didn't do anything! I just stood here and 
      stammered!
Tom: Come on! You scared her off!
Crow: Don't sell yourself short. The bald guy himself couldn't 
      have  done better.
[The Borg returns from off-stage. She no longer wears the Borg 
prosthesis, rather she now wears a silver-gray form fitting 
bodysuit, leaving little to the imagination.]
Borg: Oh. Hello again Michael.  
[The trio stands speechless for a moment.]
Mike: Um, hi.
Crow: [drools]
Borg: Although I am saddened that my presence in the Collective 
      has been terminated, I am quite happy to be spending time 
      among my new crew mates.
Mike: Um, yeah.
Tom: Who are you?
Crow: [drools]
Borg: I have long ago forgotten my birth name. Among the Borg, 
      we are  simply referred to by  number.
Crow: [Snapping back to life] You mean like 134,592,943 of 
      403,116,986?
Tom: Or Square Root of 13 of 47?
Crow: Wait, I thought she was Logarithm of 4 of pi to the  
      fourth?
Tom: No no, you've got it all wrong, she's Fourier Series of 
     Sin 2*x of the number of 1997 Denver Nugget losses.
Mike: Guys. . .
Crow: No, she's 36 of 24 of ...
Mike: Crow!
Crow: Come on, Mike. She's a babe!
Borg: [Angrily, grabbing Crow] Golden one! Are you making a 
      derogatory comment about me?  Are you, perhaps comparing 
      me to a child?
[She drags Crow off-stage. Loud noises can now be heard as Crow 
is tossed about.]
Tom: Gee Mike. Do you think that we should keep the Borg from 
     turning  Crow into scrap  metal?
[Crow shrieks as more crashes are heard.]
Mike: I suppose. Hey, Borg person! 
[She reappears, still grasping Crow by the neck.]
      Crow wasn't insulting you. He was comparing you to a 
      beloved  character  of children's  films.
Borg: [Dreamily] I remember watching this program with my 
      grandparents before my assimilation. It was one of the 
      happiest  moments of my young life. Then the Borg  
      killed them in a raid. Still, the Borg made wonderful 
      latte. And bear claws. . . [She continues to mumble]
[Tom looks at Mike, then the Borg, then Mike again.]
Tom: Mike, do you have any missing relatives?
Mike: Oh Borg? Booorg?
[She snaps back to reality.]
Borg: Oh. Yes.  Sorry. I have considered the Golden One's 
      words, and I  will  gladly accept the moniker that he has 
      given. I will proudly bear the name of that brave little 
      pig.
[She drops Crow to the floor.]
Mike: Well, that's great, um, Babe.
Tom: Glad to have you aboard.
Crow: [Still on the floor] Erf.
Babe: [angrily] What was that, Golden One?
[The lights begin to flash.]
Mike: Whoops. That'll have to wait. We've got fan-fic sign!
[Mike and Tom rush about while Babe stands aside, confused. 
Crow's still on the floor.]

[6 . . . 5. . . 4. . . 3. . . 2. . . 1 . . .]

[The trio enters and sits down.]
Tom: Wow. We've got our own little pet Borg now. Isn't that 
     cool?
Crow: I miss Gypsy. She didn't hit me quite as hard.

     replicator, nothing but net.

Crow: So, did Herb help with this story too?
Mike: Say now...
Tom: Mike, we have our own one of those now out on the Bridge.
Mike: Yeah, you're right. I better go check on her. Um, just to 
      see if she's okay, of course.
Tom: Oh, of course.
Crow: Stay away from her Mike. She's trouble.
Mike: Yeah right.
[Mike exits.]
Tom: So, will she kill him or just maim him?
Crow: My money's on 'kill.'

[Mike re-enters]
Crow: [To Tom] Damn. He's alive.
Tom: Back so soon, Mike? Did you forget about the lack of 
     atmosphere on the Bridge again?
Mike: No. Herb added some atmosphere for the union people.
Crow: Well then, how did it go with Babe?
Mike: I didn't see her.
Tom: So why are you back then?
Mike: The union people. They. They, they had their shirts off.
[All shiver uncontrollably.] 
 
>When her eyes reopened, there was emotions, passions, values, 
>and memories of her past life that seemed distorted.  

Tom: Well, yes, looked at logically Marrissa's values and 
     passions do seem a bit distorted.
Mike: Almost as if they were written by a fanfic author...

>                                                   She

>now she was strong, now she had the power.  

Mike: [standing and holding his arms over his head] BY THE 
      POWER OF THE COLLECTIVE...

>                                           There was the Borg,

      table.

>                                             Chaos must be

Crow: So pretty much par for the course then.
Mike: Like you said, he has some good insights into the 
      character.

> Images and memories flooded over Fleet Admiral Picard's head.

Tom: [as Picard] No! No! Not the OJ Trial again!

> The horrors and pain he felt when he was a part of the Borg.  
>Now his adopted daughter Marrissa was part of the Collective.  

Crow: [Announcer] Today, you too can own Daughter Marrissa in 
      this fine line of Borg collectibles from the Franklin 
      Mint.  Only 4 easy payments of $29.95!

> On his screen, he could see that admitting it pained his son-
>in-law Jay Gordon.  

Crow: [Jay] The trouble is, she's not actually legally dead, so 
      I can't inherit yet...do you suppose we could at least 
      have her declared incompetent?

>                  But the worst part was that Marrissa had too 
>much access to Starfleet defences and other secret operations.  
>She knew weaknesses on all the ships that have come out. 

Tom: Like, if you promise the crew of the Bozeman that you'll 
     send over nude gifs of Denise Crosby if they drop their 
     shields, they'll do it.  Stuff like that.

> And she had a brilliant strategical mind.

Crow: And a psychotic disregard for all life, something he'd 
      never managed to achieve.

> "Jay, what are the most likely places for the Borg to attack 
>now that they know about the Federation?" inquired the Fleet 
>Admiral.

Tom: *Picard* is asking *Jay*?!?
Mike: That's sorta like Steven Hawking asking advice on quantum 
      mechanics from Gilligan!
Crow: So, the Borg didn't know about the Federation before?
Tom:  [as Borg] Why are all these different ships attacking us?  
      It can't be  some sort of federation of planets or 
      anything...

> "Well, the only targets that I can think of that they would

Tom: What a wonderfully contrived list of targets!
Crow: [Picard] And, since SoongCorp is an invention of this 
      author, I'm betting on that one.

>      Jay listed.

[Mike, Crow, and Tom all speak at once.  Mike holds up his 
hands.]
Mike: Were we all just about to make jokes about Jay leaning to  
      one side?
Bots: Yes.
Mike: Well, let's just take them as read, then.

> "Is there some middle ground?  

Crow: Nope. The Republicans and the Democrats are still at an 
      impasse.
Tom: Remember Crow, it's a Canadian story. Their political 
     parties are the Lumberjack Party  and the Hockey Player 
     Party.

>                               A point where we can gather the 
>fleet and get to all those points within an hour?"  Inquired 
>Picard.

Mike: Once again, that pretty much describes "Middle ground" 
      doesn't it?

> "Now this is rather ominous, but the best location happens to 
>be Wolf 359."

Crow: Great! We can hide in the wreckage of their last 
      invasion!

> "How soon until your fleet can get there?"

Mike: Well, there's a pile up on the Vogon transpatial highway 
      so it'll be a while.

> "About a day or two.  The Borg managed to cut the power 
>supplies for most of the ships.  They're recharging through 
>the use, well, I don't understand the whole process,

Crow: [Jay] It's called the "Clara Sutter Handwave Procedure."
Mike: Recharging through use?
Tom: Obviously there's some piece of trektrivia we missed.

>                                                    but they 
>should be ready for action soon.

Crow: Stand by for ACTION!!!!


>The Enterprise was damaged badly, and lost most of our 
>engineering staff during the fight.  

Mike: We're down to Ensign Dilbert and Wally.

>                                     We can get the shields up 
>in about an hour, but they'll only be at twenty percent.  
>After that, we should get 100% shields in about eight hours."

Tom: Raging statistical action!

> "All right, we'll gather the fleet at Wolf 359.  And pray 
>that the results won't be the same as last time.  

Crow: [Jay] Sir, this is Star Trek.  Religion is considered 
            silly and irrelevant.

>                                                 And in 
>addition, since there's no one in charge of the fleet, I'm 
>promoting you to Rear Admiral."

Mike: And the vicious cycle continues.
Tom: Since Marrissa has you grabbing your knees all the 
     time . . .
Mike: Tom!
Tom: Oh, you thought it too.

> "Confirmed.  Thank you, sir.  Gordon out." 

Crow: So Chief O' Hara, do you think that Batman can defeat the 
      Joker's nefarious plan?
Tom: Oh, faith and begorra Commissioner.  We can only hope so.

>                                            Jay switched off 
>the connection.  The loss of Marrissa was too much to bear, he 
>was too depressed to even realise what the Fleet Admiral had

Crow: [Jay] What'd he say? Something about dogfood and Mel 
      Brooks? Ah, the heck with it!

>     Sitting in the Ready Room of his wife,

Tom: I've never heard of that part of female anatomy before.

>                                           brought back waves

Crow: Fear, impotence, failure, humiliation.

> "Jay here, what can I do for you Clara?"  Jay answered 
despondently.

Crow: [as Clara] I need a man! Quick!

> "We're back up, and ready to kick some Borg tail.

Crow: [Jay] The Borg don't have tails, Clara.
Tom: [Clara] Well, then, I'll have Dr. Johnson attach some!
Crow: [Jay] Make it so.

>                                                   Your 
>orders, Captain?"
> "That's Rear Admiral.  

Tom: [Clara, muttering] Yeah, you're half right, anyway!

>                      Keep the teams working on the Shields 
>and Weapons.  The Borg don't seem to adapt to our weapons 
>anymore, 

Mike: ...since that would be sensible, after all...

>         so lets just focus on getting as much power to the 
>phasers and shields as we can."

Tom: So, let's exploit the plot contrivance as long as we can.

> "Well, sir, I think that we've come up with a method to 
>increase the amount power we produce.  Right now, we have four 
>cargo bays completely empty."

Mike: [Clara] We can put some extra power there!

> "So?"  Jay said.  He failed to see the point Clara was 
>making.

Tom: [as Clara] Think "T.G.I. Friday's!"
Crow: Or, we could fill them full of hamsters on treadmills, 
      all connected to tiny, tiny dynamos!

> "Are you familiar with the old papers on cold fusion?"

Tom: [Jay] Yeah, it was a pretty good Web management system!

> "Ah, yes.  We tried it back in the 21th century, right?  

Tom: No, I think it was the 20st.  Or maybe even the 23nd.

> They couldn't find anything cold enough to contain the 
>reaction."

Mike: Um... well... um... how about *space*?
Tom:  Nope, not cold enough.
Crow: Did they try a dish of Klingon revenge?
Tom: I always pictured that as being like cucumber soup.

> "Well, we were going to set up fusion batteries in the Cargo 
>Bays, and flood them with liquid Nitrogen.  Then expose the 
>cargo bay to deep space.  

Mike: ...which will suck everything *out* of the bays...

>          The result should be a system that gives us lots of 
>power, and doesn't suck up the juice we make."

Mike: That wouldn't happen to be strawberry juice?
Tom: Err, doesn't the Federation use anti-matter for internal 
     power? That's a lot more efficient than fusion, hot or 
     cold.
Crow: Fan-bot.

> "Wait a moment, from what you're telling me, the system will 
>need hydrogen and nitrogen in order to run.  How will we get 
>those?"

Tom: Oh, I dunno, maybe if you had some WATER and some AIR you
     could get some?!?!

> "The replicators in the cargo bays can be set to continuously 
>produce those substances.

Mike: Here's another box of nitrogen, sir.
Crow: Good. Now get some jars of hydrogen!

>                              They can be powered by the 
>batteries too.  It's like the heart pumping blood into

Mike: [Clara; waving his hand] We call it the "By-our-
      bootstraps Method."
Tom: Good thing she waited until the last minute to invent 
     perpetual motion.

> "You're too damned smart, Clara. 

Mike: Report to Sickbay for a lobotomy.

>                                  Keep it up.  Jay out."  
>Maybe things might not be so bad after all, thought Jay.

Mike: But they probably are.

Tom: Hey, who's this Ops fella?  Seems like a regular sorta 
     guy.

Crow: [with a lisp] Don't evther sthick your tongue on cold  
      posths.

> "Clara to Bridge, were turning on the fusion batteries."

Tom: Bucka-WOW!!

>       A gasp arose from the Crew as they waited to see if 
>Clara's idea vaporised the lower portion of the ship. 

Crow: And it did. Hundreds of crewmembers were sucked out into 
      the endless void of space. Including one Ensign Adolphus 
      Throwaway Jr.

Mike: ...killing most of the crew due to asphyxiation.

Mike: A starship captain with a battery is like a little kid

Crow: Where they met the gang from Beverly Hills 90210.
Mike: I don't think this guy could write tension to save his 
      life.

Tom: [Marrissa] And I want a big bowl of M&M's in my dressing 
     room, with all the yellow ones picked out, a dozen fresh 
     roses every day, and a CD player cranking out Smash Mouth 
     & Chumbawumba 24-7!
Mike: [Borg] Are we sure we can't just clone Alice Krige?

>     Perhaps they could assimilate worlds just by showing that
>they now had her as one of them.  

[All guffaw.]
Mike: Hey, Cardassians, we've got Marrissa now!
Crow: Hey, cool!  Sign us up!

>                                 The collective wanted the

Tom: So fun isn't irrelevant?
Mike: Decent continuity certainly is.

Crow: The citizens were confused. The cubes usually arrived 
      from one of the holes leading to the planet's hollow 
      center.

>                       Moving into orbit, one ship moved out

Crow: They involved strawberry juice and a planet-sized Super-
      Soaker.

Crow: [Borg] We are Borg.  We are capable of hitting the broad

Tom: So this fits the Borg style of assimilate-and-use HOW?
Mike: I don't think they're really doing that; they're just 
      telling Marrissa this to keep her happy.

Tom: Hulk smash puny planet!

>                                With a voice that could drop

Tom: I don't think power's really changed her...she's just more 
     obvious about it now.

Mike: In a wartime situation, I don't think those two things 
      can be the same thing.

Crow: Wild, random sex in the hallways is rampant, commandments 
      are being broken around the clock and I don't think a 
      single crew member is fully sober.
Tom: Oh, like in "The Naked Now."

Mike: [Jay] Fortunately, we were able to cure everyone with the 
      biofilter in the transporter.
Crow: Oh, like they ever repeat a trick like that.

Crow: Yeah, because of your wife, pouf-pants.

>                          Jay sighed as he finished the log. 

Crow: And flushed.

Crow: Relax, that was just for old time's sake.

Tom: [Alpha leader] That depends - what's a "manoeuvre"

     doing too well.

Mike: Well, technically it wasn't "above," because there's no 
      up or down in space, and it wasn't the sky because there 
      was no atmosphere, but other than that it's basically 
      accurate.

Mike: They're in front of Fred.  Beyond that, it's not too

Tom: Well, it's not an interocitor, but I guess it'll have to 
     do.
Crow: But not excreting, so as usual, she was still full of 
      crap.

Crow: It also had stereo sound, VCR-Plus, a built-in DVD 
     player. Plus, a hammock for all the stuffed animals she's 
     assimilated.

Tom: Don't taunt him like that.

     hidden.

     Aye, there's the rub; but in these fics of fan
     What implausibilities may come must give us pause.

Crow: No, no. First she has to turn her into a dodecahedron, 
      then she can crush her and turn her into a pile of dust.
Tom: Mike, can this be happening?  Are our dreams of a 
     Marrissa-free universe coming true?!
Mike: It sure looks that way, Tom...
Tom: I wonder if this is officially in Ratliff continuity?
Mike: Official Kids Crew canon.  Now there's a scary thought.
Crow: Hey, this means Ratliff has to drop "Heir to the Throne

      was told.
      They offered her Cardassians and Romulans for slaying.
      "The Federation it must be" was all that she was saying.
      Those Borg, they tried to bribe her through offers of 
      spelunking.
      She just shouted "No!" and started screaming and 
      krunking.

Mike: Q*Bert!

Tom:  So, let me get this straight. Data, an android, brought 
      them the plans to the invincible Borg Ship?
Mike: The Borg ship is heavily shielded and carries a firepower 
      greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are 
      designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small 
      one-man fighter should be able to  penetrate the outer 
      defense.
Crow: Pardon me for asking sir, but what good are snub 
      fighters going to be against that? 
Mike: Well, the Borg don't consider a small one-man fighter to 
      be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. . .
Tom:  All right, knock it off you two.
Crow: Hee, hee.

>                 There were weak points across the cube 
>surface, but since Marrissa became the Queen they were 
>reinforced or shielded.

Crow: No originality allowed without Marrissa.

>could effect the implants on the Borg.  

Mike: So in other words things common in the damn atmosphere?

>                                      It was all vented out 
>into space through that one point.

Mike: Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The 
      shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use photon 
      torpedoes.
Crow: That's impossible, even for a computer.
Mike: [using a different voice]  It's not impossible. I used to 
      bulls-eye womp rats in my T-16  back home.  They're not 
      much bigger than two meters.
Tom:  All right! Knock it off!
Crow: Hee, hee.

>                                 There were no cutting lasers

Tom: They're going to drop a cherry bomb down there!

>the shields would keep the fires in. 

Tom: So the guys who can survive in the intense radiation and 
     absolute zero of bare space and shrug off anti-matter 
     blasts are worried about a grease fire?!?
Mike: Yeah, pretty much.

>                                      The only way to use this

Tom: Poor deluded fool.

Mike: We couldn't just estimate the mass of the debris and 
      compare it to ships sizes, no, we had to do something 
      fancy!

Tom: Then the exploding ink-packs detonated and stained the 
     loot.

Crow: [Observer voice] You are as an amoeba to us!

> "FIRE!!!!!"  Jay screamed in a mix of anger and joy.

Crow: The same way he'd said "I do" at the wedding.

> The torpedo streaked from the launcher to the shaft. 

Mike: Great shot kid! That was one in a million!
Tom: ENOUGH STAR WARS REFS ALREADY!

>                                                     Immersing
>themselves with dealing with the fleet, the Borg barely saw 
>the torpedo fling into the vent.  On the Bridge of the 
>Enterprise, the crew held their breath.  Seconds stretched 
>into minutes as the torpedo moved along it's intended path.

Mike: Ah, this must be the Federation's new "Slow Detonation" 
      torpedo!

>       Not truly caring of the attempt on their ship, the Borg 
>continued to slash open Federation vessels.  The victim of the
>torpedo managed to put away two Miranda class cruisers, along 
>with a Galaxy class frigate.  

Tom: So, the USS Enterprise-D was a *frigate*?
Mike: And the Miranda class, which is smaller, is a cruiser?
Tom: Starfleet's ship classification system seems a tad odd.

>                            A Borg Drone maintenancing the 
>waste pumping systems noticed an odd increase in the alloy 
>temperature. 

Tom: Since no one noticed the torpedo going down the stupid 
     shaft . .

>            Sending a notice to the ship centre point, the 
>drone began scanning to try and discern the cause.  The 
>solution was found when the torpedo broke through the pump 
>casing, and promptly detonated. 

Mike: Yep, that'll do it.

>                               A ball of fire expanded from 
>the waste disposal, igniting the gases in the Borg atmosphere.  
>As each of the pockets of gas became patches of fire,
>organic parts of the Borg became the same texture as burnt 
>marshmallows.

Mike: There's a Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man joke here somewhere, 
      but it just ain't happening for me.

>           The fleet cheered as pyrotechnics erupted from the 
>jet black cube. 

Crow: If the Borg would just paint their cubes red, they'd go 
      much faster.

>               There was only a single cube standing between 
>victory and the Federation fleet.  Judging from the damage the 
>phasers were doing, Marrissa was on the last cube.

Mike: They also thought that due to the fact that that cube was
      inscribing "I lost to a bunch of Borg" on the side  of 
      the  ships that it defeated.
Tom: Standard Star Trek logic: The main characters are always 
     on the last ship left.

>          Marrissa watched during the Enterprise's 
>assassination of her ship.

Tom: Assassination?
Mike: Someone used a thesaurus.

>Fires of rage burned within her.  They would all serve her, 
>they would all become drones.  

Crow: So she'll marry them and make them like Jay . . .

>                           Then, at her whim, they would die.

Tom: In other words, same plan as always.
Crow: She needed to be a Borg for this to happen?
Mike: You know, is there any real difference between Marrissa 
      as a non-Borg or Marrissa as a Borg?
Crow: Not really.  Except for that black bodysuit.

> The remaining ships needed to be out of the way.  The cube 
>was taking a pounding even as she was thinking, and the 
>Enterprise could be seen lining up for another attack, this 
>time on her ships exhaust vent.  There must be some

>The Collective debated, 

Crow: Tastes Great!
Tom: Less Filling!
Crow: Tastes Great!
Tom: Less Filling!

>                        then decided on a course of action for 
>her ship.

Crow: Um, didn't it occur to anyone that once they took out one 
      ship like that, the *just might* other might adapt? I 
      mean, them being Borg and everything...
Mike: You're talking about the Ratliff StarFleet here, Crow - 
      their motto is "One Thing at a Time".

> Jay was positive when the Borg ship swung to face his ship, 

Mike: It's a cube. It's armed on all sides. Why would it need 
      to spin?

>the game had caught up with him at last.  The Borg didn't stop 
>spinning, in fact, they built up speed.  Soon it was swirling 
>on all of its axis like a gyroscope, with increasing speed.

Mike: Killing everyone inside due to tremendous centrifugal 
      forces.
Tom: Gatchaman!
Crow: Or else the Borg are getting ready to use the Death 
      Blossom.

>      The fleet momentarily hesitated, but then continued to 
>fire phasers into the swirling vessel.  Not putting any faith 
>into their "invulnerability", the Borg swiped at any vessels

>slashed into the few android manned vessels.  One last android

>could return and assimilate them at a later date.  

Mike: Assimilate-On Dating.  Your indicator of how fresh your 
      assimalations are.

Mike: Ah, like Marrissa doing a Schwarzenegger earlier.
Tom: I suppose it'll have to do for continuity.

>      Fleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard had seen countless 
>battles, endless diplomatic functions, met innumerous races, 

Mike: And he did so irregardless of whether they were 
      inflammable.
Tom: Here's a hint, Rob - if you're gonna make up words, make 
     up ones that make sense, for crying out loud!

>and was subjected to the horrors of assimilation.  

Crow: But he had yet to meet Bob Sagat.

>of meat floating in space.  

Mike: How... disturbing...
Crow: What, Picard's going to open a deli after this is all 
      over?
Tom: StarFleet - it's what's for dinner.

>                             A message came in from Earth, and 
>was put on screen.  Captain Beverly Picard's face looked 
>satisfied when she spoke to her husband.

Crow: How's the battle honey?  Did you biff it again?

>     "Jean-Luc, the Trinity, the Pasteur and the Intrepids you 
>lent us have gathered as many people off Earth that we can.  
>We're almost over flowing, but we managed to get a million 
>people out.  There's still lots left over, though." 

Crow: Okay, so the earth's population today is - 
Mike: About 6, 7 billion, give or take.
Crow: And by the 24th century, it'll probably be up around - 
Tom: Even with colonization and emigration, probably about 20 
     billion.
Crow: And they managed to get a *million* people off? How? 
      Lottery? Random choice? People who owe Beverly money? 
Tom: Yeah, and how do you hold back the unlucky ones?
Mike: I'm betting the ones left behind are the Induhviduals.

>                                                  Beverly

>look on his face, she mirrored it.

Tom: [as Picard] Stop it!
Crow: [as Beverly] Stop it!
Tom: [as Picard] Stop repeating everything I say!
Crow: [as Beverly] Stop repeating everything I say!

>     "The Borg have destroyed the fleet.  Only the Enterprise 
>and the Kirk are left.  We're going to try and dispatch the

Crow: I'm sorry it's the only plan we can come up with. Oh, and 
      is  this a bad time to tell you I'm seeing  another 
      woman?

>   "  In case we don't make it out, I just want you to know, I 
>..."

Mike: [Picard] ...Am still waiting for that Minoxidil you 
      promised.

>     The last words never got out.  The computer terminal 
>fogged over with static, obscuring the message.

Tom: Damn you Borg! I wanted closure on that scene!

>     "Oh, am I interrupting?"  came a mocking voice.  

Crow: Q! [pause] Well, that's usually who the mocking voice is.

>                                                    Marrissa's

>Locutus.  Your fleet is destroyed, and your homeworld is about

Mike: [Borg] We are the Borg. We will have eleven billion 
      Whoppers, 3 billion without tomato, 9 billion fries, 14 
      billion cokes, and a vanilla shake.
Crow: And supersize it.

>      "Marrissa, look inside yourself.  The human part of you 
>still knows that you will not win."  Picard attempted to grab 
>at an opportunity.

Mike: [Picard] Uh . . . oh yeah?

>"Think of what would happen if you did win.  

Tom: [Marrissa] Oh, I *am*, baby - I AM!!!

>responsible for it. Could you really live with that knowledge?  
>Could you live with killing off the resisting forces, knowing 
>that your husband and child were with them?"

Crow: [Marrissa] So what's your point?

>       "Your logic is unclear.  To us the masses would not be 
>killed, they will be added to the Collective.  Their energies 
>will be put towards more fruitful uses.  They will help us 
>attain perfection."  The Queen argued.

Crow: I blame Pat Buchanan for this.

>       "At what cost?"  Picard retorted.  "You want to strip 
>them of feelings and emotions.  How do you know that won't 
>destroy the perfection you expect to achieve?"

Mike: A good point, but I think his move is still to bore her 
      to death.

>       Marrissa seemed to be momentarily lost in thought. 

Crow: Ah, unfamiliar territory.

>The collective recalled many of the races that they had 
>assimilated.  There had been many creatures with high 
>emotions, such as love, hate, sympathy, 

Mike: And appreciation for Garth Brooks music.

>                                                        and it
>was nearly their destruction.  "Emotions have been proven to 
>be counterproductive."  The stone-hard face responded.

Mike: Marrissa only knows about emotions second hand, however.

>         "Oh, really?"  Picard smiled, he'd caught her.  "If 
>emotions are irrelevant to the Borg, why do you feel them?  
>You are drowned in hate, desires that are not your own.  

Mike: o/~ She's a brick and she's drowning slowly... o/~

>                                                      If you 
>feel these emotions, then you are counterproductive to the 
>Borg.  You must be removed."

Crow: Score one for the Pic-man here!
Tom: Well, Rob may not have seen "Disaster", but he's obviously 
     seen "The Changeling".

>       Rage danced across Marrissa's face, then halted.  
>"Perhaps you are correct, Locutus.

Crow: As a side note, I always assumed that they picked Picard 
      to assimilate  just because his head is easier to attach 
      stuff to.

>                                   You would be valuable to 
>have back in the Collective.  Your knowledge and abilities 
>would have greatly aided us. I will destroy you in a moment." 

Crow: Oh, let me put that in my scheduler.

>The screen went blank.

Mike: The Borg's screen saver must be activating.

>                      Picard couldn't believe he'd just signed 
>his death warrant.  Marching out to the Bridge, Picard ordered 
>the Tactical to fire all the Quantum torpedoes at the exhaust 
>port when the cube stopped.  The torpedoes streaked away,

Tom: Look at that, look at that.

>                                                        and a

[Once again, balloons and confetti fall from the ceiling of the 
theater. By now, the balloons are noticeably deep.  Mike and 
the bots dance around again.]

Crow: Hey, Marrissa! I know where Wesley is hiding!
Tom: Whoa!
Mike: So he killed off Picard?
Crow: Well, Ratliff DID waste Riker once.
Tom: Cool. For once, we get to leave on a happy note!
[The trio exits the theater.]

[1. . . 2. . . 3 . . .4 . . . 5. . . 6 . . .]

[The trio returns from the theater. The union members are 
nowhere to be seen. Babe stands alone at the console, standing 
at attention.]

Mike: Oh, hi Babe.
Babe:  Hello, Mr. Nelson. Have you made any progress on 
       returning this unit to the collective?
Mike: Well, we still don't know where the collective is. . . 
Tom: I do.
Mike: [aside] Shut up Tom.
Babe:  Well, this unit will continue its exploration of what it 
       means to be human.  By the way, is it customary for one 
       to leave their undergarments lying around on the floor?
Mike: [sheepishly] Sorry. Those are mine. I'm afraid that it's 
      been a long time since there were any other humans 
      aboard. I'll take those.
Crow: We wouldn't mind if you left *your* underwear lying 
      around though.
Mike: [aside] Shut up Crow!
Babe: This unit has already discovered the feelings of 
      "disgust." Perhaps this unit should investigate the human 
      means of reproduction.
[Mike blushes deeply while the bots make "bucka-wow" noises.]
Babe: I'll need a test subject. . .
Mike: Well, I guess that I can help you with that. . .
Tom:  [snicker] Oh, this ought to be entertaining.
Crow: [snicker] Don't do anything that I wouldn't do Mike.
Babe:  You! Gold One! You will assist me!
[Babe grabs Crow and drags him offscreen. Crow gives a shriek 
of alarm as he's dragged off stage.]
[Mike stands beside Tom, stunned. Tom looks at Mike for a 
moment.]
Tom: Boy Mike, just when you thought that your self esteem 
     couldn't get any lower, the only human female around for 
     parsecs chooses . . .
Mike: Tom, if you value your existence, shut up.
Tom: Yes, sir.
[Noises occur offscreen. We hear shouts of joy from Babe, 
various crashing sounds, Crow yelling in terror, and a cuckoo 
clock. Mike and Tom continue staring off screen towards where 
Crow and Babe left the Bridge.]
Tom: That must have hurt.
Mike: Yep.
[A few moments pass. More things crash.]
Tom: Say, could you do that?
Mike: My joints don't bend that way.
[More crashes. Crow screams in terror again.]
Mike: Hmm. That'll leave a mark.
Tom: Yeah.
[Babe yells.]
Mike: Ooooh.
Tom: Ahhhh.
[A furious crescendo of noise erupts from offstage. When the 
noise ends, Mike begins to clap loudly while Tom raises a  
lighter into the air. Moments later, Babe walks back into view 
with a towel wrapped around her shoulders and a smile on her 
face.]
Babe: Well that was refreshing.
[Babe walks off screen. Crow wanders back into view, visibly 
dazed.]
Crow: [Dazedly, but in a much deeper voice than normal.]  So, 
      that's what it's like to ,um. . .
Tom: Engage in shuttlecraft operations?
Crow: Yeah, that euphemism will work.
Mike: Crow, I hate to break it to you, but that wasn't sex.
Crow: What?
Mike: That wasn't sex Crow. She was mostly pounding your head 
      against a wall.
Crow: Are you sure?
Mike: Believe me, there is a subtle difference between the two    
      experiences.
Crow: Bummer. [Pause] So, maybe on our second date?
[The fan-fic sign begins to flash.]
Mike: Darn. I guess I won't have time to answer, because we've 
      got fan-fic sign!
[The usual antics ensue. The door sequence begins.]

[6. . . 5. . .4. . . 3 . . .2. . . 1. . .]

[Mike and the Bots enter and sit.]
Crow: On the third date?
Mike: Crow, she nearly dismembered you.
Crow: Oh. The fourth date then?
Mike: Tom, talk to him.

Crow: Bingo!

>       The numbers were understandable: 

Crow: They average out to 25, and since 2+5 is 7, and there are 
      7 letters in the name "Clinton", this *proves* the Borg 
      are controlled by the Tri-Lateral Commission!
Mike: What was *that* all about?

Mike: [Jay] Hey, there's drones going through my underwear.

Tom: The Canadian spelling would be "Nouegat."

Tom: American-built ships have "Bridge", decks 2, 3, etc.  
     British-built ships start with "Bridge", *then* deck 1, 
     then 2, 3, etc.
Mike: But neither has a deck 13.

Mike: ...somehow sending no-name cannon fodder after his kid

Mike: See, that refusal to send anonymous underlings to vicious 
      and pointless deaths is what's holding Jay's career back.
Tom: Yeah, how can you get to be a captain without killing off 
     your excess ensigns?

>   At deck 21, Jay held back Shayna and Alex.

Crow: Yep, again, future of all the galaxy in your hands, save 
      one baby.
Mike: Maybe it's a STNG/Willow crossover ?

Tom: Amazing!

Mike: All of this just to save a coin collection.

Mike: [Jay] Nougat!  Nougat!  Look how fast this is!  Whoosh!
Tom: Nouegat, Mike. Nouegat.

      have a malfunctioning front anti-gravity unit, so that 
      the cart will wobble?

Crow: It's Lone Wimp and Cub!
Tom: Unfortunately, he had the controls set too high and

Tom: Although as clues go that's a pretty good one.
Mike: "Have gone to Engineering, will be back after while.

Tom: [Borg] I am Carrier of Borg. You will assimilate warmth in

Tom: Borg EXTREEEEEEEEEME! 
Crow: This SATURDAY!
Tom: SATURDAY! 
Bots: SATURDAY!
Mike: I thought you guys had gotten over that.

      to help?

>                    The team broke into a sweat just after

Tom: [Jay] *huffhuff* Boy, guys, *wheeeeze* we're really, 
     _really_  out of shape! *GASSSP!*

>                                Making their way along the

Crow: They were THAT boring.
Mike: [Borg] You just see someone?
Tom: [Borg] Nah.

Crow: She's never gotten over Blake marrying Krystle.
Mike: [Alexis] Father...you abandoned me in my hour of

Tom: Like father...like daughter...think about it, won't you?

Mike: [Jay] You just hear a scream?
Tom: [Alex] Nah.
Crow: [Shayna] Nah.

>                             provoking a response from the

Mike: But enough about Marilyn Manson...

>                    After telling the positronic brain inside

Crow: Hey! Where the kid go? I'm sure I put it in here. . .

>                                   the trio ran off towards 
>the scream, while the stroller dutifully lowered itself into

Mike: Then the stroller, tired of being enslaved, sold out to 
      the Borg.

>          Reaching the source of the noise, the group found 
>themselves outside sickbay, confronted with three drones 
>surrounding a lone individual.

Tom: They'd spaced themselves at even 120-degree angles.  The 
     Borg are like that.

>The man was doing an odd little jig,

Crow: The Borg are assimilating the Lord of the Dance!
Mike: Good!
Crow: But that means once they've added his distinctiveness to 
      their own, there'll be trillions of Borg faux-Irish 
      dancing their way across the galaxy, all naked from the 
      chest up!
Tom: Yeah, but the infusion of ego will tear the collective 
     apart.

>                                   as the Borg nanoprobe 
>injectors continuously snaked out into his neck.  

Tom: Ah.  The Trek equivalent of the tentacle scene.
Crow: I see Marrissa taught them sadism as well.

Mike: Wha-huh?
Tom: Did the Borg just shoot themselves?
Crow: Not the most effective shock troops, eh?
Mike: Crow, don't you start acting Canadian too.

>       Only then did the victim take note of his rescuers.  

Crow: Well, I'm glad that's ovYAAAAAAH!!! Don't sneak up on me 
      like that!!

>Immediately, Doctor Jackson Johnson tried to compose himself 
>in front of his crewmates.

Mike: Myself.  A composition by Jackson Johnson, the man with 
      Action Traction.

>       "Doc, that was incredible.  How did you prevent the 
>assimilation?"  Jay inquired incredulously.

Tom: And why didn't you TELL us you could do it?
Crow: I practiced safe Trek, and made sure all the implants 
      wore protection.

>        "With this," the Doctor replied while holding up a 
>hypospray, 

Mike: I call it a "sonic screwdriver." Jelly baby, anyone?

>          "I got the idea from the nanoprobes the Borg have 
>been using.  With some modifications, I enabled them to put 
>out a profile that tricks the Borg probes into thinking its 
>blood.  

Tom: Hey probe!  Your blood!
Crow: [probe] What about it?
Tom: Think about it...always rushing through your veins at 
     hundreds of miles an hour...
Crow: [probe] Yikes!

>     Then, when they try to assimilate it, the probe holds on 
>to the Borg probe, preventing assimilation.  One of my probes 
>can hold about ten of the Borg probes, so it should be
>adequate protection."

Mike: Other anti-assimilation measures work on the principle of 
      tricking the body into thinking it's been assimilated, 
      physically preventing the probes from entering the body, 
      or just applying lots of probicide. Some people try the 
      Rhythm method to avoid assimilation too. 

>                     While he droned on, 

Tom: Get it?!? 'Cuz it's Borg, see, and he's "drone"-ing on,   
     and, and, and - it's just FUNNY, is all!! LAUGH!!! 
     LAUGH!!!!!!!!

>                                         Dr. Johnson injected

Crow: Dr. Johnson actually got the idea from the alien race 
      called the Plahts.
Mike: You mean?
Crow: Yes. [Brief pause] They're shooting themselves up with 
      Plaht Devices.
Tom:  Mike, hit him. Hit him hard.

>       "We should wait here a while longer, so I can whip up 
>more probes for everyone else," stated Jackson, ushering the 
>trio into sickbay.

Tom: Oh, and I cured cancer, extended the human lifespan and 
     found ways to double our intelligence.  Sorry, forgot to 
     tell you.

>       The one who would not assimilate was rescued,

Crow: That's my favorite bedtime story.
Mike: What?
Crow: "The Borg Who Wouldn't Assimilate." In the end he learns 
      to assimilate and the Borg Queen tells him how much she 
      loves him.

Crow: Whoops. The Borg must have assimilated some of Neelix's 
      food.
Tom:  Wrong show.
Crow: Who cares?

>        A loud rapping came on the door of sickbay,

Mike: Avon calling!

Mike: Of course, they all just fell through the weave because 
      they're MICROSCOPIC, but it's the thought that counts.

Tom: Meaning that they were easier to tell apart. [begins to 
     hyperventilate]
Mike: Now, now, Tom.
Tom: I'm sorry, Mike, but they can't bounce off my Teflon 
     coating forever.

Crow: One of the selling points of the Enterprise-F is its 
      convenient  "Vulcan in every room" feature.

> "What are the odds that we can repel this attack at our

Mike: Never tell me the odds.
Tom: [whimpering] Please no more Star Wars, please. . .

>       "Approximately 1349.264 to 1, sir"  the Vulcan replied 
>after a moment of calculation.

Mike: [Jay] Darn it, man, don't give me these generalities, I 
      need cold hard numbers!

> "In other words, not good. 

Crow: Still, it's better odds than you'll get at most casinos.

>continued.

[Pause]
Mike: I guess we don't get to find out what he said when he 
      continued.  Rats.

> "Maybe sir," Shayna confirmed.

Mike: I may not have done well in English, but that was not a 
      "confirmed."

> "All right; Kathy, Clara, Shayna, and Alex.  

Crow: [Jay] Under Anime Five-Character Theory, I'm the hero, 
      Alex is the big guy, Kathy is the chick, Clara is the 
      other guy and Shayna is the pet.  Any objections?

Tom: But instead he stonewalled, hoping he could keep that up 
     until the end of his term.

Mike: Well, he convinced the Borg to drastically increase their 
      fat intake. They then dropped dead from heart attacks 
      forty years later.

Mike: That's it, they're doomed.

Mike: No. The Borg.

Tom: Which belied its feelings of sheer terror at even having 
     to say the words.

>The entire ship, or what was left of it, was now in the hands 
>of Jay's sister-in-law.

Mike: Yep, 23rd century.  We've gotten over racism, sexism, and 
      poverty, but not nepotism.
Crow: Since it's Marrissa's sister, she'll be slaughtering 
      Romulans by the dozens in a matter of minutes.

Mike: Large, drunk, rabid bears.
Crow: Large, drunk, rabid bears with big, sharp, pointy teeth.
Tom: Large, drunk, rabid bears with big, sharp, pointy teeth

     officers and now they're out for blood!

Mike: Ironically, upon reaching the Transporter, they were all 
      killed by a small, healthy bear.

Mike: She was using that tanning bed again.

Mike: But if you're Kids' Crew, you can just waltz right in.
Crow: One of the many advantages of having the writer on your 
      side.

Crow: [drone] Well, I keep meaning to exercise, but then

Mike: [mumbling] Sure, I came up with that theory two 
      paragraphs ago, but of course the Captain takes all the 
      credit...

>quiver in his voice.

Tom: Only held about a score of arrows.
Crow: A hundred and forty-four arrows?  That's a mighty big 
      quiver!
Tom: No, a score, not a gross.
Crow: [clearly not getting it] Right.

> Jay considered for a moment before replying.  "No, keep on

Crow: Unless, of course, they're trying to attack us when we 
      don't expect it.

Crow: Power Pack?
Tom: Oh, please, no!

Mike: "You enter a ten-by-ten room. There is a treasure chest 
      guarded by a Borg and a large blue dragon"
Tom: I ready my +12 Hackmaster. . . 
Crow: Isn't it usually ten feet by ten feet?
Mike: Well, Canada, metric system.
Tom: Actually, that's "Moetric" system.

Crow: So how come it's "litre" but not "metre?"

Mike: [Ensign] Well, I'm a nameless ensign in a Trek fic, so

Mike: Ah, Ensign Easily-Distracted!

     the front in big friendly red letters.

[All snicker]
Tom: "Bionic Zombies"?!? You have *got* to be kidding me!
Mike: "Bionic Zombie Nightmare", starring Tia Carrere as 
       Lindsay Wagner!

Tom: The ship only had basic cable, but the cavity had a 
     satellite dish.
Mike: The ship was covered in peeling wallpaper, while the 
      cavity  was painted in tastefully muted pastels.
Crow: The ship only had 8-year old copies of "Good 
      Housekeeping", whereas the cavity had the latest 
      bestsellers from Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler and Jude 
      Devareaux.

Mike: The Borg apparently have perfected their  "awe" ray.

>cubic object with a dark doorway in the side of it.  

Tom: Apparently at some point, the Borg assimilated M.C. Escher 
     and  Salvadore Dali.
Mike: Timothy Leary, too.

>Connecting the portal with the door was a long, narrow bridge 
>that was thirty meters long and only sixty centimetres wide.  

Mike: Uh-oh. I feel a story problem coming.

>Crossing the precarious bridge went slowly, as the crewmates 

Tom: ...were accosted by an old man asking them questions 
     three.

Crow: Did I miss something, or did we just suddenly switch to 
      "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"?

Tom: [Borg] We are the Borg. Danger, Will Robinson.

>                                         The Collective put 
>its plan into action, and two drones disappeared in a green 
>flash.
>

Mike: Making two drones disappear - what a clever maneuver!
Tom: Manoeuvre.
Mike: Whatever.

>      Kathy's scream echoed throughout the cavity.  Whipping 
>their heads around, they were able to see a drone with its 
>nanite injectors implanted into Kathy's neck.  

[More balloons descend from the ceiling.]
Tom: [Kathy] Like, don't leave a hickey, Todd - dad'll, like, 
     kill me!

>                                             Already blood 
>arteries were clouding into a greyness,

Crow: Y'know, if your "blood arteries" are visible I think 
      you've got other problems.

>                                       and soon she would be a 
>part of the Collective.

Tom: That would be a loss...if I could remember who Kathy is.
[Pause]
Mike: I'm sure she's appeared before.  She must've.
Crow: Not Ratliff's most memorable creation, I guess.

>                       Another drone beamed in front of Jay, 
>who was still at the front of the group, and tried the same 
>tactic.  

Crow: But Jay screamed like a girl and dove off the platform  
      first.

>      Jay weaved as much as he could without losing his 
>balance, and managed to use his rifle as a club.

Mike: Coming up, Jay vs. Nitro on American Gladiators!

>                                                The drone
>hit the hull of the far-away airlock with a barely audible 
>thud.

Crow: I know how he feels.
Tom: Say, when are you gonna make another mile-high meringue?
Crow: Soon. First I've got a recipe for chocolate-mayonnaise 
      cake I want to try.


>    Shayna had managed to fire an EMP burst into the drone 
>that assimilated Kathy, who was still in shock with a dazed 
>expression on her face.  Her mind opened to the Collective 
>like a book, 

Crow: A Little Golden Book, actually.

>            and they saw the plan.  

Tom: [Shayna] Oh, *good* one, Kathy.

>                                   At the other end of the 
>bridge, drones swarmed onto the plank chasing the invading 
>Starfleet officers. 

Crow: [Borg] We are the Borg. Time to walk the plank, matey. 
      Arrh.

>                    Two pieces of titanium alloy emerged from
>the top and bottom of the black portal and slowly began to 
>inch shut.

Crow:  No!  They've only got four hours to get there before it 
       closes!

> Jay noticed the action and screamed in defiance.  

Tom: Maybe he was screaming for NEEEEL! NEEEL!! NEEEEL!!
Mike: Probably not.
Tom: Or maybe for VAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCE!
Crow: Unlikely.
Tom: Or maybe...
Mike: Tom, please don't -
Tom: For JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
     EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
     EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
     EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!

>With a burst of adrenaline, 

Crow: Speaking of which...
Mike: You done?
Tom: For now, Mike - for now!

>                           he rushed across the remaining 
>distance and jumped through the portal. 

Tom: "Sliders", starring Jay Alan Gordon.

>                                        His friends barely 
>managed to make it after him, with Shayna executing a diving 
>roll to clear the door before it shut.  

Crow: This must be some new definition of "slowly inching 
      shut."

>                                      Jay and Alex took the 
>time to use their EMP Rifles to fry the door's circuitry, 

Crow: Actually, you get a lot less fat if you *bake* the   
      circuitry instead.

>while Clara scanned the area. 

Mike: [Clara] BABYLON...PSYCHIC...SCAN!
Crow: Oh, joy.
Tom: "Sailor Babylon." Now appearing in finer archives near 
     you!

>                             The drones were not happy at
>the thought of being locked out, and began pounding on the 
>door.  

Mike: [Borg] We just want to talk to you about HerbalLife!

>     Taking a survey of the area, it was your standard sized 
>room with four walls.

Crow: As opposed to your non-standard sized room with eleven   
      walls, two floors, five ceilings and a henway.
Tom: Are you gonna fall for that?
Mike: Nope. It's probably just another 10' x 10' room.
Crow: Fine, spoil my little joke - see if I care!


>One of them however had been replaced with a viewscreen 
>looking out at the Enterprise.  

Mike: Hey, HBO's running "First Contact" again.

>                                 Towards the middle of the 
>room, some sort of structure seemed to grow from the floor.  
>Immersed in an eerie red light, 

Tom: The Borg have a red light district?

>                                  there seemed to be a figure 
>inside it.

Crow: [hums the music from "Close Encounters"]
Mike: It was to be a gift to your President...

>        Getting closer to the configuration, the jaws of the 
>hardened Starfleet Officers slackened.  They began to 
>recognise the figure in the centre of the monument. 

All: ABRAHAM LINCOLN OF BORG?!?!?

>                        It was Marrissa.
>

Crow: Oh, *her*.
[The Text abruptly stops.]
Mike: Hey!
[A voice calls out from outside the theater.]
Voice: What?
Mike: What happened to the story?
Voice: I stopped it.
Crow: I'll regret asking this but, why?
Voice: I'm on break.
Tom: Well, I guess we should leave then.
Crow: [mumbling] Blasted union help...

[The trio leaves.]
[1. . . 2. . . 3. . . 4. . . 5. . . 6 . . . ]

[Mike and the Bots enter the Bridge, which is now full of 
people.]
Mike: What the. . .?  Tom, you didn't rent the satellite to the 
      Heaven's Gate people again?
Tom: No, they're not supposed to be here until next week.
Mike: Well, what the heck is going on then?
Tom: Gee Mike, calm down.
Crow: Yeah Mike. You're going to burst a blood vessel or 
      something.
[Next to Crow, a balding man materializes out onto the bridge.]
EMH: Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
Mike: There's no medical emergency. These two are just over 
      reacting.
EMH: Surely someone here has a medical emergency.
Crow: Well, Mike snores sometimes.
Mike: I do not! [To the EMH] Look, I don't know why you're 
      here. This ship is supposed to only have one person and 
      three robots on it. We've got no need for a doctor! A 
      mechanic, maybe, but not a doctor.
EMH: I see. 
[The EMH disappears, and reappears a moment later, this time 
dressed in a jumpsuit similar to Mike's, but covered in 
grease.]
EMH: Please state the nature of the mechanical emergency.
[Mike shakes his head and grabs a passer-by.]
Mike: Excuse me, but. . .
Crewman #1: Oh, hi there Captain!
Crow: Captain?
Tom: I think he's talking to Mike.
Crow: [Sarcastically] Oh, really?
Tom: Well, yeah. When I mustered out of the Vengosian Navy, I 
     was a Commodore, so they must be talking to Mike.
[Mike stares at Tom for a moment before turning back to the 
Crewman.]
Mike:  Yeah, I guess that I'm the Captain here. Who are you?
Crewman #1: I'm your helmsman, a nave Ensign on his first 
            cruise.
[A second crewman walks up to Mike.]
Crewman #2: And I'm his best friend, an ex-con with a heart of 
            gold, who's assisting you on your mission ,Captain.
[A third member of the crew walks up, this one has tattoos on 
the side of his face.]
Crewman #3: And I'm. . .
Mike: Never mind. I don't care who you are. 
[Mike turns to the bots.] Goodman must have something to  
      do with this.
[Mike turns to the crew and points to the Bridge's window.] 
      Look! A sub-space anomaly!
[The crew gasps, and rush over to the window. The EMH goes with 
them. Mike shakes his head and then hits the communication 
light.]

[The Studio]
[Well, it used to be the studio. But now it resembles a small, 
messy apartment. Posters of people skiing adorn one wall. In 
front of the viewscreen is a young man with long, blonde hair, 
wearing a ski cap.]
Chip: Mikedude! Hey, glad to see you again!

[SoL]
[Mike looks at the bots, who shrug.]
Mike: Nice to see you too. [pause]  Who are you?

[Apartment]
Chip: Mikedude! I'm like, really bummed out that we haven't 
      been able to get you down from there yet! But alas, our 
      rent's due , and Topher's locked in the bank vault with 
      our money and that sexy stewardess that he's had his eye 
      on. So,  Christo is looking for. . .
[The doorbell rings]
Chip: Dude! Our landlord! Gotta hide! 
[Chip  rushes about frantically before hiding in the closet. 
Moments later, the door opens and Pearl, dressed in a sweater 
and a pair of pants.]
Pearl: [Flatly] Chip? Topher? Christo? I need your rent check. 
       Are you here? 
Chip: [Muffled] We're not here!

[SoL]
Mike: Pearl! Finally! Someone sane!
Crow: Loosely speaking, of course.
Mike: Well, that goes without saying. What's going on around 
      here?

[Apartment]
Pearl: [Flatly] Say, I think that I'll just sit here and wait 
       for Chip to come back home.
[Rustling noises are heard in the closet. Pearl scans the room 
for a second and then moves in close to the screen and speaks 
softly in her normal tone of voice.]
Pearl: Hi Mike. Herb decided that the viewers couldn't relate 
       to us, so he decided that a trio of wacky, fun-loving 
       snowboarders should be accidentally sending you the  
       movies. 
       [Forcedly] I'm the boys' mean landlord. Oh, and he has  
       Brain guy doing hemorrhoid ads. [She shrugs.] That's 
       kind of bad for him, I guess.

[SoL]
Tom: What happened to Bobo?

[Apartment]
Pearl: [Sighs] He'll be here in a second.
[The door flies open. Bobo's now dressed like Kramer with the 
fur on the top of his head is arranged in Kramer style.]
Bobo: Hey Pearl! Does Chip have any walnuts?
Pearl: I. Don't. Know.
Bobo: How about a pressure cooker? [He begins to root around in 
the kitchen.]
Pearl: [Leans closer to the screen.] Mike, get me out of here. 
       I'll take you back to Earth. I'll stop showing you bad 
       movies. I'll do anything. Just get me out of here.

[SoL]
Mike: No more bad movies? Hmmm.  [Pause.] Okay, you've got a 
      deal. Crow, think that you can handle this one?
Crow: Sure Mike. I'll just grab a Powerbook, a can of silly 
      string, and my chainsaw, then. . .
[Babe enters the scene.]
Babe: You! Gold one!  I wish to explore my violent feelings! 
      Come with me!
[Crow screams in horror and tries to run away, but Babe grabs 
him by his head thingee and drags him off stage. Moments later, 
we hear Crow's shrieks of terror intermingled with the sound 
out metal clashing on metal. Mike looks in the direction that 
the pair disappeared, nods and then turns to Tom.]
Mike: Okay Tom. Your turn. 
Tom: Right! GROOOOOOWWWWWWLLLLLL!!!!!!!
[With a growl of fury, Tom rushes off the stage.  After a 
moment, Tom rambles back into view.]
Mike: Well? How'd it go?
Tom: Well, I rushed into Herb's office and told him that we 
     weren't going to be his little  pawns anymore.
Mike: [Pause] And?
Tom:  You know, he's really a nice guy. . .
Mike: [Burying his head in his hands] Tom. . .
Tom: Do you know what merchandising is Mike? It's a really cool 
     thing. See, he gave me a box of cool stuff. There's a Tom 
     Servo Coffee mug, a Tom Servo T-shirt, Tom Servo 
     keychains, Tom Servo boxing robots, Tom Servo funny foam, 
     Tom Servo gardening tools, Tom Servo fire extinguishers. . 
[Tom continues to describe the various items. Mike looks back 
to the camera.]
Mike: I guess that it's up to me then. Well, I've got a plan to 
      free you, Pearl.[The lights begin to flash.] But, darn. 
      It looks like that'll have to wait until after we're done 
      with the story. [He grins evilly] Gee, I could have freed 
      you now if you hadn't sent us  this literary masterpiece. 
      Have fun with the snowboarders!
          
[He hits the light and the door sequence begins.]

[6. . . 5. . . 4 . . . 3 . . .2 . . . 1 . . .]

[Mike enters, carrying Tom, who is still talking.]
Tom: And Tom Servo Lunchpails, and Tom Servo Disposable  
     Toilets, and Tom Servo Brand  SSMs, and . . .
Mike: I get the idea Tom. Say, where's Crow?
[Suddenly, a scream is heard in the theater. Crow's been thrown 
through the air and he impacts against the screen before slowly 
sliding down the screen to the ground. ]
Babe: [Outside the theater] Thank you for your help Gold One!
[Crow picks himself off the floor and slowly seats himself.]
Crow: Mike, your plan better work cause I'm not going through 
      another session of that.
Mike: Relax, the plan's already in motion.

Crow: Wondering where the heck the Borg kept the Charmin...

>                                            Marrissa had fires 
>blazing in her eyes every bit as intense as a star.  Despite 
>the tubes protruding from various parts of her body, she still 
>drew eyes to her untouched face. 

Tom: [Marrissa] Look at me!! LOOK AT ME!!!!!

>                               Her skin glistened with days 
>of accumulated sweat, and her once fair blond hair was 
>streaked with grime and oil.  Her voice boomed as if it
>was possessed by a goddess, despite its lack of use.

[All snicker.]
Mike: Oh yeah. Marrissa *never* uses her voice.

>       "Foolish individuals," stated the Queen, "you dare to 
>confront the Queen of the Borg?  

Crow: Any minute now, she's gonna jump on a broom and write 
      "Surrender Kids' Crew" in the air.

>                                   Your biological and 
>technological distinctiveness will be added to our own.  
>Standby for assimilation."

Tom: And stand by. . . . . for news!

>       The Borg refrain coming from Marrissa's lips chilled 
>Jay to the core of his being.  Despite every instinct telling 
>him to get as far away from this place as possible, Jay stood 
>his ground.

Mike: Mainly because Jay has all the survival instincts of a 
      refrigerator magnet.

>           Drawing a breath, he prepared to confront his 
>former wife.

Crow: I want my record collection back!

>       "Marrissa, don't you recognise us?  It's Jay, Clara, 
>Shayna, and Alex. We're here to rescue you,"  he announced.
>       "Rescue me? 

Tom: o/~ Oh take me in your arms.  Rescue me.  . .  o/~

>                  Why would I require rescuing?" she asked.  
>With a mechanical zip,

Crow: Oooh, a Zip Drive!
Tom: Yeah, when you're Borg, you can afford the best.
Mike: That reminds me, how's your 5 1/4" drive, Tom?
Tom: Slow, Nelson, really slow!

>                       the implants connecting Marrissa to her 
>chair withdrew.
>The freedom of movement was granted to her, and she stood to 
>face the Starfleet Officers.

Mike: [Marrissa] Can I get anyone a drink?

>       "I am about to invade Earth, crush Starfleet, and come 
>closer to attaining order for the galaxy,"  she announced.

Tom: [announcer] See it *live* on "When Kids' Crews Attack" - 
     Tuesday on Fox!

>       Undaunted by her stubbornness, Jay continued,  "Don't 
>you remember who I am?  I'm Jay, your husband.  We have a 
>daughter.  Do you remember Sarah?  

Mike: You might be serving her as dinner at somepoint in the 
      future. . . 

>                                We both love you Marrissa.  
>Come back to us.  We love you!"

Tom: o/~ We love you Ri-isa, oh yes we do.
         We love you Risa, and we'll be true. . . o/~

>      Upon hearing this, the intense glare of Marrissa's eyes 
>wavered and softened.  She lost her balance and had to grip 
>the armrest of her throne.  A tear welled up and began to 
>travel down her cheek.  

Crow: And somewhere in the background, that stupid Celine Dion 
      song is playing again!

>                       She opened her mouth to speak again.  
>Her jaw was unsteady, and the words were pronounced slowly.

Crow: "Bite. Me. Dickweed?"

>      "You ... love me?" the shaken Queen asked.  As Jay 
>nodded his head in confirmation, she began to speak again.

Mike: Feed my sheep.
Tom: Huh?
Mike: It's a Biblical reference - look it up.

>      "Love ... is irrelevant. 

Crow: Well, I never heard that "Love Is" before.

>                              You will be assimilated without 
>any further delay."

Mike: Right after this commercial message.

>       Her balance was regained, and her jaw was set.  The 
>softening visage of the Queen had solidified into the ruthless 
>face of a swallower of souls. 

Tom: Well, she's back to normal, then.

>            The transformation put Jay and his friends in 
>shock, allowing the Borg to make the next move.
>       Marrissa threw an arm out in a dramatic motion that 
>encased the four people inside a force field bubble.  Pulling 
>out her hip disrupter,

Crow: Man! That disruptor's so hip, it can't see over its own 
      pelvis!

>                      the Queen used it to vaporise the door 
>holding back her drones.  They entered the room only to find 
>the threat ended.

Mike: [Borg] Darn, that didn't work eith- I mean, we're 
      certainly glad you're all right, your highness.

>      With the threat to herself and her ship over, Marrissa 
>turned to the viewscreen. 

Tom: [British] And when we say "You will be assimilated without 
     any further delay", we mean there will be *some* delay 
     involved.

>                         With a creak of hydraulics and 
>motors, the screen split into halves and slid into the wall.  
>Located behind the screen was a ring-shaped device. 

Tom: And here at the Shane Company, each ring that we  
     manufacture is a unique creation, whether it's a 
     wedding ring, an engagement ring, or a time travel device.

>                                                     It was 
>about two meters in diameter, and was glowing a silver colour 
>along its circumference.  With a sweeping gesture from the 
>Queen, the device flared to life.  

Crow: [Marrissa] Mirror Mirror on the wall, who's the most 
      tyrannical of  them all?

>                                    The centre of the ring 
>filled with an odd liquid that suspended itself in the centre.
>Rippling along its own little plane,

Mike: Here's the World War I Flying Ace, in his Sopwith Camel, 
      commanding the skies!
Tom: [makes ek-ek-ek-ek sounds]
Mike: Oh no! He's been hit! CURSE YOU, RED BORGQUEEN!!!

>                                  the liquid changed from a 
>solid silver to a mirror of Marrissa's room.  The mirror then 
>refocused on what looked like another part of the Borg ship.

Tom: [Marrissa] I bet that little tramp Cindy Ann Borg has been 
     talking about me behind my back! We'll just see about 
     that!

>      Inside the bubble Jay looked on with worry,  "Clara, 
>what is that thing?"  he fretted.

Mike: A Tantalus Device?

>     "I'm not sure," Clara said with curiosity edging her 
>voice,  "the tricorder says the liquid in the middle is a 
>concentrated form of Chroniton Particles."

Crow: A Guardian of Forever?
Tom: Or a new Slurpee flavor.

>     "Time Travel?" Jay deduced,  "But why would they want to 
>do that?

Mike: Unless... Good lord! The Borg must be responsible for the 
      Cubs' losses in the World Series!

>They've destroyed their opposition and Earth is just a few 
>thousand kilometres away."
>     "Because the present amount of drones is not acceptable 
>to complete the assimilation of your planet,"  Marrissa's cold 
>voice interrupted.  "By retrieving drones from the destroyed 
>Borg ships, we can replenish the force without requiring 
>assistance from additional units."

Crow: Um, can't they just make *new* drones as they go?
Mike: Shhhh - you'll disturb the plot device.

>     As if on queue, a drone dropped out of the portal, 
>landing flat on the deck.  After depositing about thirty 
>drones,

Mike: ...for the next three minutes...

>        the portal shimmered and changed its view to another 
>interior of a cube.  During the switch, Marrissa's face 
>contorted in concentration.  

Crow: [Marrissa] What's that song running through my head?    
      Deedeedeedada, deedeedeedada, dumdumdumdumdadadum...

>                           After the view change, she
>seemed to be physically drained by the effort.  Lights 
>flickered around the room, and the force bubble made a high 
>pitched whine.

Tom: [Henry Fonda] That's the sound of the ambassador's phone 
     melting!

>              This did not go unnoticed by the captive 
>officers who began to formulate an escape plan.

Crow: [Jay] Clara, lie on the cot and act sick. Alexander, when 
      Marrissa comes in to check on her, choke her with the 
      fishing wire! Any questions?
Tom: [Alex] We don't have a cot, or a wire, and Marrissa 
     doesn't care if we live or die.
Crow: [Jay] Crap! Okay, plan B: we beg like terriers for our 
      lives!

Tom: Or we could phaser our way through the floor. [pause] Nah.

Mike: Great big huge rabid grizzly bears with hangovers that -
Tom: We finished that section already, Mike.
Mike: Oh, sorry.

Crow: Mainly he distracted them by running around in a blind 
      panic.

>                     The termination of the drones registered 
>to Marrissa as if one of her limbs had fallen asleep.

Mike: So she picked up a drone and started shaking him.

Tom: They stuck her implant in a bowl of warm water, and...

>     Shayna vaporised in a silent flash of light.  

[More balloons continue to fall from the ceiling.  It's now 
getting a bit crowded in the theater.]
Crow: The light was silent, but Shayna's cries of agony were 
      really, really loud.

>                                                 This went

Tom: Ah, who knows?

>brought his rifle around just in time to end the existence of

Tom: [blearily] I'm not as think as you drunk I am!

>             then followed the drone to the deck.

[More balloons.  The bots' silhouettes are nearly masked by the 
balloons]
Mike: But she missed the deck and began to fly.

>fallen wife was the only planet in the universe,

Tom: Alex was married to a planet?
Crow: [as minister] Alex, do you take Jupiter to be your 
      lawfully wedded wife?

Crow: But enough about Wu-Tang Clan.
Mike: And enough about musical comparison jokes, already!
Tom: I think he's overreacting to her liver spots.

>became the Queen of the Borg, and the Queen was happy in her

Mike: She'd forgotten how much fun it was to boss her friends 
      and elders around.
Crow: Yeah, it's much more satisfying when your victims can 
      squirm a little.

>          The revelation of this stunned Marrissa.  The 
>Collective said she had been taken for granted, her values,

Mike: Well, the last part's right, at least.

>                                        If this was a lie, 
>how much else was?  She mentally screamed to the Collective to

Tom: [Marrissa] I know you're there! Pick up, you wimps!!
Crow: [Borg] "Assimilate Marrissa," you said! "We can control 
      her," you  said!


>     In the scene before the Queen, the battle reached its 
>turning point. Alex sobbed over the loss of his wife, and

Crow: DEBBIE!
Mike: Clara, Crow. Clara.

Crow: Weenie-boy to the rescue!

>     His mourning period had passed, and a red curtain 

Tom: So the Borg assimilated a theater somewhere along the 
     line then?

Tom: Unfortunately, it clashed horribly with the off-white

Mike: Good night everybody!

Mike: Get ready for... MORTAL KOMBAT!

>      The first two drones stumbled right in and were 
>dispatched with a horizontal slash, followed by an overhead 
>cut.  Another duo attacked and were dispatched with ease.

Mike: This *is* the same Alexander who can't hold a sword 
      straight on DS9, right?

>Despite the danger, Alex found the combat more calm and paced 
>than when he and his father trained on board General Martok's

Tom: Kiss the floor, baby! *Mwah!*

>                                                           The

Crow: The tattoo artist of death claims Alexander.
Tom: We shall attack you with pins. Resistance is futile.

>After a brief moment, Alex's mind began to cloud with the 
>thoughts and memories of his wife, of his crewmates on the 
>Enterprise, and of thousands of others he didn't know.  

Mike: Rick Berman, Jeri Taylor...

Tom: Al Capone, Salmon P. Chase...
Mike: Joe Garagiola, Minnie Driver...
Crow: Nefertiti, Methuselah...
Tom: Stephen Ratliff, Rob Tonts...

Mike: Goodbye, New Jersey!

>                         It had been a good day to die.
>

Crow: It had been St. Swithin's Day!

>       Despite the racket caused by the dropping drones, Jay 
>managed to hear the photon grenade's arming tone quite 
>clearly.  Looking Alex's direction, he could see both of his 
>friends were on the floor, bordered by drones in a similar 
>state.

Mike: They're totally baked, man!
Tom: Dude! Got any munches?

>                             He could also see the blinking 
>light of the grenade in Alex's bandoleer.  Proceeding to his 
>fallen friends, eliminating any drones that showed themselves, 

Mike: [British] These drones have not learned how not to be 
      seen.

>Jay stooped down and took the armed grenade.  It was preset 
>for five minutes and had begun counting down.  

Tom: Good Jay. Set the grenade to go off after you've all been  
     assimilated. Good plan.

>               Jay had noticed Marrissa was moving in her 
>chair.  Her attempts at conversation with the Collective were 
>futile.  They attempted to feed her the same type of story 
>they had before. 

Crow: [Borg] We are the Borg. The dog assimilated our homework.

>    When they saw it wasn't working, the programming embedded 
>in Marrissa's mind was reactivated with a vengeance.

Tom: [blankly] I must kill Frank Drebin.

>                                                       She 
>smiled a smile of the devil and took aim with her disrupter.  
>Jay had beaten her to the trigger however, and fired an EMP 
>burst into the throne.

Tom: Okay, here's something that's been bugging me since the 
     start of the story - the Borg can regenerate from massive 
     damage.  Even huge holes in the ship from photon torpedoes 
     can be fixed in mere minutes. So *why the Hector Elizondo 
     is a little electromagnetic pulse suddenly putting them 
     down for the count*?!?!?
Crow: Ummmmmm - it's a Kryptonite generated EMP?
Tom: Oh. [pauses] Well, that's different.

>      Electronics overloaded, melted and detonated throughout 
>Marrissa's chair.  A power surge flashed through throne, into 
>the Queen and out to the time gate.  

Crow: Remember, *always* use a power strip!

>                                    Marrissa began convulsing 
>as the images in the gate began to shift rapidly though 
>different scenes and different time periods.  When the 
>convulsing stopped, Marrissa drooped in her seat like
>a convict after the electric chair.

Mike: Appropriately.

>                                    The time gate had also 
>settled, showing a representation of a Starfleet vessel's

Crow: With any luck, it's B'Elanna's!

>     Gazing at the grenade's timer, which said he only had 
>four minutes before it destroyed the room, Jay looked for a 
>good place to hide it.

Tom: Finally, he dropped it in one of the big gaping holes in 
     the plot.

>                       Placing it under the time portal, Jay 
>turned his attention back to his wife.  She still had signs of 
>life,

Mike: [Jay] Crap! Missed!

>      but unless he helped her soon she would die from the 
>electrical shock.  Using the discarded kut'luch, Jay sliced 
>the binding implants from the chair.  The razor sharp blade
>managed to cut through the wires in almost a minute.  

Crow: [Raspyni Brothers] Even the carrots we use...
All: *Razor Sharp*!!

>                                                     Jay then 
>hoisted Marrissa up and carried her away from her former 
>prison.

Crow: Then, thanks to the hundred or so pounds of implants, Jay 
      collapsed to the deck in excruciating pain, his spine 
      sticking straight out of his back.

>    Tapping his combadge, Jay spoke, "Enterprise, two to beam 
>up."
>    Silence responded to his call.  

Mike: [Jay] Ensign Silence, beam us up immediately!

>                                   Of course, he thought, the 
>magnetic shields are still up.  There's no way off this ship.  
>Unless, Jay's mind whirred, the time portal could work as a 
>two-way street.

Crow: Well, with Jay's luck, it'll be a double-yellow line two 
      way street with safety cones blocking off one whole lane.

>    Carrying Marrissa as if they were about to cross the 
>threshold, Jay stepped up to the silvery hoop.  Gathering a 
>deep breath, he leaped into the time gate.

Tom: And over the broom.

>                                         He felt a sensation 
>that could be compared to jumping through a thin, continuous 
>waterfall.

Mike: So, he got briefly wet then?

>                                      Then the queasiness of 
>zero gravity grabbed a hold of his stomach and spun it like a 
>gyroscope. 

Crow: o/~ You spin me right round, baby, right round, like a 
      record baby, right round round round... o/~

>          His senses were bombarded by unclear images and 
>multitudes of colour. 

Tom: Super Freak-out! By Ohio Arts.

>                         He felt himself drift away from 
>reality, only to have the sensation ended by something cool, 
>hard, and fuzzy.

Mike: He's landed on Barney!
BOTS: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! BACK TO THE BORG SHIP, QUICK!!!!

>      The time portal deposited its two unexpected travellers 
>in the Starfleet quarters it had shown.  Jay struggled to 
>regain the balance he lost during his trip, and surveyed the 
>room.  Despite his lack of focus, the room seemed vaguely 
>familiar.
>

Mike: [Jay] Where am I?
Tom: The Village.

>      The walls nearby were adorned with two paintings.  
>Standard furniture sat in its place across the floor of the 
>abode, except for what looked like a rocking chair between the 
>couch and the door leading to another bedroom.  Behind Jay was 
>a hallway, that branched in two directions,

Mike: And Jay took the lesser used one. And that made all the 
      difference.

>                                           into a washroom and 
>into a room with a crib.  

Crow: You have: A bathrobe, a toothbrush, a thing your aunt 
      gave you which you don't know what it is, pocket lint, 
      and no tea.

>                                             With a few 
>moments of orientation, Jay managed to focus.  One of the 
>paintings on the wall depicted a blond-haired girl leading her 
>group of friends out of the forest of a planet.  

Mike: It was Denise Richards from "Starship Troopers".

>                                                  The other 
>showed the same blond girl on a Galaxy-class starship's bridge 
>with a Cardassian Galor-Class vessel dominating the 
>viewscreen.  

Tom: You know, we're never going to forget those episodes in 
     Marrissa's life, the way they keep bringing these 
     paintings up.

>                                         From the room with 
>the crib, a contented cooing bounced into the room.

Tom: Awww, it's little baby pigeons!

>                                              Jay matched the

>of vertigo forced Jay to sit in the nearby rocker. 

Mike: Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak force Jay to do their 
      bidding.

>                                                   The 
>rocking chair seemed vaguely familiar.  It had an antique air, 
>and had cushions that moulded to fit him.  The nausea passed

Tom: Then the nausea came crashing back full force.

>                                            The similarities

Mike: [Steven Wright] They stole all my stuff and replaced it 
      all with exact duplicates.

>     "Computer,"  Jay rasped, "what's the date?"

Crow: June 12, 1997.
Mike: Of course! The Borg sent him back in time so that he 
      could attend the Lilith Faire!

>     "The Current Stardate is 62492," the computer stated.

>     The Computer had responded with numbers that corresponded

All: WHAT?!?
[All the collected balloons and confetti disappear in a pop.]
Tom: I call no fair! Marrissa was done for!

>                           The last wisps of fog cleared from 
>his memory, and he remembered his wife. 

All: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Crow: [Marrissa, groggily] C'mon, mom, I don't wanna conquer 
      the galaxy today - lemme sleep!

>"Medical emergency. Standby for incoming patient.  Transporter

>

Mike: [Transporter guy] But I'm not sick!

>     Jay unclipped his combadge and placed it on Marrissa's 
>chest.  

Tom: Allowing him to cop one last feel.
Mike: Tom! They're married! He doesn't need to cop a feel!
Tom: We're talking about Marrissa here, Mike.
Mike: [pause] You're right. Never mind.

Crow: [Jay] If I start out in a shuttle *now*, I can be to Zeta

Mike: [crewman] What's up with Commander Weenie?
Tom: [crewman] With him? Who knows?

>    Minutes later, the turbolift deposited Jay on the Bridge.  
>Surprise oozed from each of the personnel.  Giving in to the 
>desire to know what they were staring at, Jay surveyed

Crow: And compared the results to the original abstract.

>        His uniform had been soaked with sweat and moisture.  

Mike: But we washed it in all-temperature Cheer, and look - 
      it's clean as a whistle!

>

Crow: [Jay] You! Stand on your head and recite the Pledge of 
      Allegiance! You! Send a program of easy listening music 
      to the Cardassians! And you! Hose me down with pineapple 
      juice!

>    "Shayna, go to Red Alert and order the fleet to do the

Tom: Hey, if they've gotten back to before it all began, 
     shouldn't there be a spare Jay and Marrissa running 
     around somewhere?
Mike: Ummmmmm -
Tom: Unless a tree fell on them or something.
Crow: Maybe they first ones blinked out of existence when the 
      second ones arrived?
Mike: They were probably just swallowed by the plot holes.

>   Shayna's hands danced gracefully over the controls as she 
>carried out her Captain's orders.  As the deflector dish 
>spewed its beam of energy, Shayna decided to ask what the

Mike: That's actually a good question to ask *before* you fire, 
      Shayna.

>            Her question was answered as the ray sliced into

>coordinate the fleet into a preemptive strike.  The Defiants 
>of the fleet clustered together and dove towards the nearest 
>cube in a suicide dive with torpedoes and phasers firing all

Mike: Ah, I see they've found firing them only part of the way 
     just isn't an effective tactic.

>           Seconds before impact the Defiants broke off into

Crow: Including each other.
Tom: AIM, people, AIM!!! AIM!!!!!

>                   The Enterprise had launched her fighters 

Mike: Along with Wade McClusky's  flight of torpedo bombers. 
      Their goal: The IJN  Kaga.

Crow: Not to mention friendly cover fire from Han and Chewie 
      on the Millennium Falcon.
Tom: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crow: Hee-hee-hee!


>      The fleet was getting worn down at the same time as a

>from a Borg ship.  The Enterprise had recharged her deflector

>to wait for the ship to move and ordered Shayna to fire. 

Tom: What?
Crow: It seems Jay's getting a tad bloodthirsty. Marrissa would 
      be so proud.
Mike: Right about now, the Bridge crew's probably wondering 
      if it would be a bad thing if Jay was "accidentally"
	shot in the back by the Borg during the battle.

>                                            Satisfied the cube 
>was out of the way, Jay chose his next target. 

Tom: Please say it's Craig Kilborn!

>                                                   It proved 
>him wrong, however, as it fired an EMP burst into the 
>Enterprise's rear shield.  As the damaged cube exploded, 
>another cube had managed to get close enough to beam in a

Crow: Boarders who party? Maybe Chip, Topher, and Christo came 
      aboard.

>      "Captain," Shayna's voice called, "we have invaders on 
>deck 21 and on deck 30."

Tom: [Jay] See if you can get Namor's autograph.

>     "Dispatch Security Teams," Jay ordered, "Tell them not to 
>worry about the Borg adapting.  In their present state they 
>can't adapt, control their ships, and direct their drones at 
>the same time."
>

Crow: They can't?
Mike: Not if the Federation wants to win this, they can't.

>    "Aye sir," Shayna responded.
>
>     Meanwhile the Fleet was coping well.  The tactical groups 
>were making impressions on the remaining four cubes, one of

>The ships that were immobilised had repaired themselves and 
>got back into the fight.  

Tom: Who thinks Rob's entire idea of strategy comes from 
     playing "X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter?"
[Crow and Mike raise their hands.]

>                                       the Borg were now
>being more random with their cutting lasers, waving them back 
>and forth at the clusters of Starfleet ships. 

Tom: [Jay] See if you can get Namor's autograph.

>                                               Lasers met

>succumbed to the attack, being slashed across the engines.
>

Crow: Is it just me, or does anyone know what ships are firing 
      what at who, and why?
Mike: I think Rob is making up for all of Stephen's one-
      sentence space battles at once.

>    The Enterprise had recharged the deflector dish, but Clara 
>announced it would be the last shot before the dish could not

Crow: So is that up, or over, or head-over-butt, or what?

Mike: This is Red Five, I'm going in!
Tom: Mike. No more, please...


>     "Tactical, arm quantum torpedoes and launch them into 
>that cavity on the Borg ship," Jay ordered.

Tom: We've filled them with fluoride, right?
Mike: Jay Gordon, Starfleet dentist.

>                                            "Then fire the 
>dish at the cube to the port of the current target."
>

Tom: [Jay] Then have the dish run away with the spoon.

>     The Nova-class Carrier launched the silver bullets of the 
>torpedoes straight at the ship's heart.  Then turning 
>slightly, fired the blue-while beam into the another cube.  
>Both detonated silently in space.
>

Mike: Oh, now he's just showing off.
Tom: Sounds like Jay's acquired Marrissa's powers via osmosis.

>     "Lets help the fleet with that last one," Jay commanded.
>

Crow: Oh, let's not and say we did.

>      The Enterprise charged the final cube where the 
>fighters, Defiants, and the other starships were swarming over 
>the target.  The cube was putting up as much of a fight as it 
>could.  It was becoming tough to hit the cube without winging 
>a disabled ship in the process.

Mike: Fortunately, we've already seen that Jay doesn't care 
      about that.

>                                The EM pulses were damaging 
>the fleet's offensive capability and had knocked out the
>Enterprise's shields.  The Federation flagship reached weapons 
>range and attacked with all the conventional weaponry it could 
>muster.
>

Mike: Tanks, bombs, guns. They were all thrown against the 
      Borg.

>      "This is security team Beta 21 to the bridge," a voice 
>filtered through the intercom.  "All the Borg suddenly 
>vanished.  There are no further contacts.  Security team 2012 
>out."
>

Mike: [Security Voice] We're goin' back home - it's almost time 
      for "Xena".

>      Something was looking up, 

Mike: Something - or some*one*?!?

>                                 until Shayna announced, "Sir, 
>there's a massive energy build up in the cube!  It looks like 
>it's going to self-destruct!"
>

Crow: Then it exploded, confirming the hypothesis.

>    "Order all operational ships to use tractor beams to tow 
>whatever ships they can out of the blast radius!  Do it now!" 
>Jay responded.
>

Tom: Well, he could tow them away later, but what would be the 
     point? 
Crow: [Jay] Oh hell. Let's just blow them up now. It'll save us 
      the work.


>     In a slow retreat, the Federation backed away from the 
>Borg vessel towing what they could manage.  

[All make beeping sounds]

>                                           The cube vaporised 
>into thin air,

Crow: Despite there not being any actual air for it to vanish  
      into.

>leaving behind a massive blast of energy equivalent to the 
>white hot intensity of a star.  The surviving ships were home 
>to amazing celebrations and victory parties.  The Enterprise 
>was no exception, as the crew abandoned their stations to give 
>applause and congratulations to each other. 

Mike: Um, shouldn't we be, like, tending to the wounded, and 
      rescuing people trapped in disabled ships, and-
Crow: Yeah, yeah, in a minute! First - JELLO SHOOTERS FOR 
      EVERYONE! WOOHOO!!
Tom: And no one noticed the warp core about to explode. Which 
     it did. The end.

>                 Jay was possibly the only one who was still 
>duty bound and got up from the command chair.
>
>      "Alex, you're in charge," Jay called over his should as 
>he made his way to the turbolift.
>

Crow: Over his should, but behind his could and beside his 
      would.

>      Ever since Jay's transport of Marrissa into Sickbay, 
>things have been going crazy, thought Doctor Jackson Johnson.  

Crow: Jarvis Jannson...
Mike: Jemimia Jellico...
Tom: Jam Jellyfish Jacob Jingleheimerschmidt Junior.

>                                             He barely had 
>time to put her in a stasis field when the battle started.  
>There were a few injuries but nothing that medical techniques 
>couldn't cure. 

Crow: Dear lord, what's wrong with Marrissa?
Mike: The diagnosis just says "Spiceworld."
Crow: Well then, there's nothing we can do for her then.

>       That was about an hour ago.  Since then he and his 
>medical staff had been working on their Borg/Marrissa.  That 
>was creepy enough to make him not want to know what put her in 
>that state. 

Tom: Would you really want a doctor who was easily creeped out?

>            The surgery was finished, the implants were 
>0removed, 

Crow: But she was joining the class-action suit anyway.

>           the nanoprobes were filtered out of her blood, and 
>her hip had been regenerated.  Marrissa was still unconscious 
>but she'd be coming out of it soon.  Jackson had left the 
>recovery ward to bring in Jay and Sarah who had been watching 
>the entire operation.
>

Mike: [Sarah] Look, daddy, an intestinal wall lining!
Tom: [Jay] Y-yeah, that's n-n-n-nice, sweetiAABLEARGH!!!!

>      After escorting the Gordons in, Dr. Johnson left to 
>attend to other duties letting the family reunite.  Marrissa 
>was the only one occupying the recovery ward,

Mike: Or so the Germans would have us believe. . . 

>                               as the injuries from the battle 
>were not very serious.  She lay on a bio-bed which displayed 
>all her life signs were in normal condition.
 
Tom: Ego already re-inflating, thirst for power engorged, 
     personality stable at one dimension - yep, she's normal.

>                                            It also showed 
>the anaesthetics were almost entirely removed from her blood.  

Mike: But there were still signs of trendy redrum heroin in her 
      Blood.
Tom: Mike! NOOOOO!


>Jay stood over his wife, her golden blond hair had been 
>cleaned to remove the black and grey streaks.

Crow: Lather. Rinse. Assimilate. Repeat.

>                                              Her arms were 
>no longer encased in Borg armour.  The grey arteries and veins
>had reverted to their natural colours.  A smile formed on 
>Jay's face for the first time in several days, 

Mike: He'd finally realized why Marrissa liked slaughtering
      things so much. It was so much fun!

>                                              as he watched 
>his wife's eyes flicker open.  

Crow: Damn! Jackson, you told me she was dead!

>                                The violet pupils were 
>unfocused when they opened, but soon focused on Jay's face.

Tom: [Marrissa] Oh, hi, weenieboy, have you wrecked the ship  
     yet?

>       Marrissa slowly came back from the blackness.  Instead 
>of the thousands of voices welcoming her, there was only one, 
>her own. 

Mike: Well, it was louder than all the others anyway.

>    Her eyes opened and blurred, unaccustomed to the 
>brightness of the lights.  After a few moments she could see 
>clearly a man holding a little girl standing over her.

Tom: It was Mr. and Mrs. Woody Allen.

>                                                         Her 
>own memory supplied names and relationships, and she 
>remembered her husband and her daughter.  It also recalled 
>other names and faces of her friends, and her brain wondered 
>where they were.  

Tom: Then she remembered, Marrissa has no friends, just 
     possible tools in her quest for power.

>                  It all returned in a rush.  Her 
>assimilation, the destruction of Essex, her adoptive father's 
>death, the eradication of Starfleet, and the murdering
>of her closest friends. 

Crow: Except for the assimilation, she'd had a swell time!

>                                Overwhelmed by the horrendous 
>things she had done, she reached out for the only comfort she 
>could get.
>

Crow: And Bill Clinton was there....

>      It was as if Jay could see it happening.  Her 
>recollection of all the events to the time she was knocked 
>unconscious.  He could only imagine what she was going 
>through.  

Mike: She's probably going through the same sort of hell that 
      Jay lived through in every day of their joyless marriage.
Tom: SUFFER MARRISSA, SUFFER!

>         The warping and destruction of her values
>and morals was going to do emotional damage that would take 
>quite a while to heal.  

Crow: That is, it *would*, if she had any - Marrissa will be 
      up and sending ensigns to shallow, meaningless deaths 
      by Thursday.

>                           She reached out to him, longing for 
>his comfort, 

Tom: After getting the comfort, Marrissa planned to smack him   
     around a bit for trying to kill her.

>            and he returned the embrace.  

Crow: Marrissa was now one of the Kindred. 

>                                          Sarah was enfolded 
>into the hug and they remained that way for what seemed like 
>days.  Marrissa wept freely, Sarah babbled with no concept of 
>what happened, and Jay pondered. 

Tom: Is it trite to say that, in this case, I completely 
     identify with Sarah's feelings?

>                                                                                    
>He wondered how it was possible that more than a week ago he 
>had questioned his love for this woman.  

Crow: We're still wondering why you didn't question it even 
      earlier than that.

>                                       He had risked himself, 
>his crew, and the future of humanity to bring her home safely.

Mike: Thus giving evidence that Vitamin C does not trigger 
      bloodfeud obligations.

>enjoyed the time they shared.

Tom: [Marrissa] Jay, why did you try to keep from becoming one 
     of my Borg slaves?
Mike: [Jay] Well, I , ah. . .
Tom: [Marrissa] Jay, go put on the punishment suit.
Mike: [Jay] Yes ma'am.

>Time:  Not Applicable
>

Mike: Boy, even with the accumulated knowledge of dozens of 
      species, the Borg still can't set the clock on a VCR.

>      The last Borg cube had overloaded almost all the power 
>supplies it had to force itself outside time.  They could 
>spend the time they needed to repair the ship, then return to 
>the Delta Quadrant and get additional ships. 

Crow: But first, a little side trip to Wednesdays at 8:00, 
      7:00 central, to boost some ratings.

>                                             All without 
>worrying about lost opportunities.  Drones scuttled

Tom: [Borg] Did we pack everything? I don't want to have to 
     turn the whole collective around because someone left a 
     book in the dresser.

>                                                                                       
>However, some drones had more important jobs. 

Crow: Like manning the soda machine.

Mike: Yeah, they always are.

Tom: [Borg] Blonde Borgs have the same fun.

Mike: Wanna bet who they are?
Tom: I think we all know.

Tom: Okay, just tell us it's them.
Crow: Yeah, quit wasting time and give with it!

>                      the faces remained untouched.  

Mike: C'mon, we know who they are, already!
Tom: Just say it!
Crow: *Say it!*
All: SAY IT!!!

>They were Marrissa and Jay.

All: BUM-BUM-BOMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!
Tom: The reaction - dull surprise!

Crow: It'd *better* be!
Tom: Time for your little plan, Nelson.
Crow: It'd better work.
Mike: It will. Trust me.
Crow: I've got a really bad feeling about this.
Tom: [Sobbing] Enough with the Star Wars already!

[They exit.]

[1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 6 . . .]
[There's even more crew members milling about now than there 
were last time. Tom and Crow are wandering about the Bridge. 
Mike is nowhere to be seen.]
Crow: Mike?
Tom: Miiike?
Crow: Do you think he found another escape pod and left without 
      telling  us?
Tom: No, it's still under the theater seat where I left it.
Crewmember #4: Hi! I'm the character representing an oppressed 
               minority in today's society. . .
Tom: That's nice. Mike!
Crewmember #5: And I'm the young scientific wizard!
Crow: Mike!
Crewmember #6: And I'm Sarah Alara Pic. . . 
Bots: MIIIIIKE!!!!!!
[Suddenly, the hexfield opens. Mike appears on the screen. He's 
once again dressed like Katherine Janeway.]
Mike: Attention all crew members! Dangerous alien snipes are 
      attempting to board our vessel through the cargo bay! 
      Head down there and repel the boarders!
[The crew rapidly exits the stage, leaving Tom and Crow behind. 
Mike runs in from the right of the screen.]
Mike: Quick Crow! Wait until they're all in the cargo bay and 
      then open the hatch!
Crow: Gotcha! Okay, now!
[The scene shifts to an exterior shot of the Satellite of Love. 
There is a burst of air and then a multitude of bodies are 
blasted out of the cargo bay.]
Tom: Mike? You do realize that you just sent  over a hundred 
     people  out into the void of space to meet  their doom?
Mike: Relax. A  shuttlecraft or a runabout or something will 
      rescue them.
[Back outside, a small ship appears next to the former crew 
members, who disappear in a sparkle of light.]
Mike: See? They're fine. Now to deal with Herb. . .
[As Mike, turns towards the viewscreen, a bright flash of light 
illuminates the bridge.]
Mike: What was that? 
Crow: Oh, nothing Mike. Just go about your business.
Mike: Oh. Okay.
Tom: [To Crow] The shuttle blew up, didn't it?
Crow: [To Tom] Yep. Don't tell him. It'll break his little 
      brain.
Mike: Okay Herb. I know that you're there. Answer.

[Apartment]
[Herb and Curtis stand in the foreground. Pearl's in the 
background.]
Herb: Nelson, did you just space those actors? Their union's 
      going to complain about that.

[SoL]
Mike: Forget that Goodman. We're not playing by your rules 
      anymore. 
Tom: Yeah!
Crow: Down with the bourgeois!

[Apartment]
Herb: Nelson, you seem to forget. I've got a contract. I can do 
      anything that I want to that little show of yours. You 
      can be easily replaced. Gallagher hasn't been doing 
      anything lately. . . 

[SoL]
Mike: I scoff at your empty threats!

[Apartment]
Herb: And your little friends can be replaced too. We haven't 
      seen Alf or those cute little Ewoks for a while either. . 

[SoL]
Tom: You fiend!
Crow: Mike, you can't let him do this to us!
Mike: Relax, guys.

[Apartment]
Herb: Or I could just change your show's format. Say, make it 
      into an X-Files show, but make it more like Friends. 
      Yeah, that's what I'll  do all right . . .
[There's a knock at the apartment door. Herb looks puzzled.]
Herb: Who is it?
Muffled Voice: Girl Scouts.
Herb:[Walking to the door]  Oh, is it cookie time again? Well, 
     I suppose that I can afford to buy a few boxes.
[Herb opens the door, and then jumps back in shock as Gypsy's 
mouth clamps down over  Herb's head and torso and drags him off 
screen. Moments later, Gypsy enters through the door.]

[SoL]
Mike: Great work Gypsy! I knew you could do it!

[Apartment]
Gypsy: Well, of course I could do it Mike. I do have an IQ of 
       6,000 when I'm not running the ship. [Mumbles] And you 
       use it by having me  swallow someone whole. Should I 
       hold a door open for you next?
[Curtis is backing towards the door. He's stopped by Pearl.]
Pearl: Going somewhere?
Curtis: Hey, I'm just the hired help around here.  I was just 
        following  orders.
[The Observer walks through the open door.]
Pearl: That's okay. The Observer's just following orders too.
Observer: [Grasping Curtis by the shoulder] Normally, my race 
          dislikes  violence. I'll make an exception this time.
[Curtis screams as the Observer drags him out the door.]
Pearl: Nice job Nelson.

[SoL]
Mike: Thanks, Mrs. F. And Gypsy, we're glad to have you back. 
      And we're even happier that Pearl promised to take us 
      home and stop showing us these horrible movies and fan-
      fics!

[Apartment]
Pearl: Oh. Yeah. I did promise that, didn't I? Er, well. . .
[Pearl stops as she sees something on the floor near the door. 
She reaches down and hold up a piece of paper marked "Deed."]
Pearl: Hmm. Herb must have dropped this. . . 
[She opens it up and reads softly out loud.] 
       Castle Forrester? {Pearl grins a very evil grin.] Of 
       course. I'll be glad to take you home.
[The Observer has reappeared. Pearl hands the deed over to him. 
He looks it over briefly and then he begins to chuckle evilly.]
Pearl: We'll take you home right now, won't we Brain Guy?
Observer: Oh yes. We'll head back to Earth right now.

[SoL]
Mike: Great! Let's get started!
[An auburn haired woman walks onto the stage.]
Woman: Excuse me. I'm Claudia Christian. My agent told me that 
       you had a part open?
Mike: [To Pearl] There's no hurry getting us back.


[Studio]
Pearl: Okay Mike. We'll head back to Earth right away. [To The 
       Observer] Will you do the honors?
