This is it. The product of my last two and a half month's toil. Along with my
own personal struggles, this encapulates the struggles of eight other brave
MSTiers:

Karen Kallestad
Tom Currie
Petera Mitchell
Tv's Francis
Brian Dubic
Satya
Jim Whaley
and
Glazed McGuffin Man (Steven Bateman)


So, show your support for these brave MSTiers, and read this MSTing. Send any
C&C to me, Tv's WereTorgo, at torgo@nettaxi.com, and it'll be forwarded to
whomever needed.

In the not-too-distant future
Way down in Deep 13
Dr. Forrester
And Tv's Frank
Were hatching an Evil Scheme
They found a janitor named Joel
Just a regular fellow, somewhat droll
Their experiment needed a good test case
So they conked him on the noggin and they shot him into space... (get me down!!!!!!)
"We're sending him awful fanfics
The worst
We have read(la la la)
He'll have to sit and watch them all
Or else he won't get fed."
Now keep in mind
He can't control
When the story begins or ends
Because he used those special parts
To make his robot friends!"
ROBOT ROLL CALL!
CAMBOT (Elusive fellow)
GYPSY (What's with Basehart?)
TOM SERVO (Sarcastic little--)
CRO-O-O-O-W! (Nutball!)
If you're wondering how he lives and breathes
And other science facts (la la la)
Just repeat to yourself:
It's just a show
I should really just relax!
For Mystery Fanfic Theater: 3000!

[1...2...3...4...5...6... SOL]

[SOL. CROW and SERVO are in each others faces.]

JOEL: Oh, hi everyone, welcome to the Satellite of Love. You caught
	us at an awkward time... see, both Crow and Tom are avid fans
	of comedies from the thirties, aren't we all, and the inevitable 
	argument has just popped up--
CROW:  [to SERVO] Yes, of course, but they only had TWO members, which
 	certainly reduces potentials!
SERVO: Yes, but they're MUCH more experienced than *your* pet band of 
	hoodlums, and their characters are MUCH more true to life!
CROW:  But tell me, smarty pants, why they couldn't possibly sustain a
 	seven reel film!? Could it be because [in a mocking tone of voice]
 	they're too WEAK to stay in the ring?
SERVO: Oh, and *your* little pet friends could?! What about those dreary
 	little numbers they made with MGM!?
CROW: You *know* it's because MGM toned them down!
SERVO: Ah-HA! Then how come when MGM took over Laurel and Hardy nothing 
	changed!?
CROW: The Marx Brothers would win in a fight to the death, pure and
 	simple.
JOEL: [interjecting, to camera] It's the Big Debate: "Who would win in
 	a fight to the death, Laurel and Hardy or the Marx Brothers."
SERVO: You wish! Hardy could take Harpo *and* Chico! Groucho would just
 	run away!
CROW: Not if he was in a Paramount picture, he wouldn't!
SERVO: But he isn't!
CROW: [childishly] Yes he is!
SERVO: [childishly] No he's not!
CROW: Is too!
SERVO: Is not!
CROW: IS TOO!
SERVO: [enjoying it] Is not!
CROW: [crying] Joel, Joel! Make Servo stop!
JOEL:   How about if you two compromise? Let the Marx Brothers be in their
	Paramount years, [CROW looks at SERVO triumphantly] but in return we'll 
	put Laurel and Hardy in their vintage Hal Roach years.
CROW: WHAT!?
[SERVO snickers]
CROW: Oh well, it doesn't matter! Harpo could still take Laurel on!
SERVO: Yes, but Hardy could dismember Chico *and* Groucho!
CROW: What about Zeppo? Huh?
SERVO: Hey, no fair! He doesn't count!
CROW: Ha-ha, sucker... it's a Paramount film, after all!
SERVO: [crying] Joel, make it fair! Crow has four and all I have are 
	two!
JOEL: Well... how about if we add Curly Howard to your team?
CROW: [at the same time as SERVO] No FAIR!
SERVO: [at the same time as CROW] All right!
JOEL: [as yellow light flashes] We'll be right back. [hits the light]

[commercials]

[ SOL. CROW and SERVO are offscreen. JOEL is behind the desk, reading "Harpo Speaks."
  In the background one can hear both "Horse Feathers" and "Pardon Us." As JOEL reads quietly,
  the BOTS begin to argue again. ]

CROW: Now, just *look* at that editing... or lack of same. The Marx Brothers would be running
	circles around those pansies!
SERVO: Ah-HA! But look at all those jumpcuts! Either the Marx Brothers were edited by a blind
	first-grader, or some "fan" decided to cut this scene up!
CROW: Shut up! At least it means that people actually *wanted* to watch this movie. Even in an
	era of the Hays Code!
SERVO: Oh, bite me.

[Silence, save for the movies.]

CROW: Actually... that Laurel is pretty funny.

[Red light begins flashing. JOEL, not looking up from his book, smacks the button.]

[Deep 13. DR. F is center screen.]

DR. F: Well, hello, Joel T. Humphinbouchin. I hope you have an Invention for us?

[SOL. CROW and SERVO have both stopped watching their movies, and are behind the desk with
JOEL. JOEL is holding a contraption, which appears to be a Game Gear, connected to a wire,
which is plugged into John Grisham's "The Pelican Brief."]

JOEL: Of course we do. Our invention for this week is, well, an amusment piece. See, I was
	partaking in a reading of John Grisham's "The Pelican Brief," and I suddenly realized 
	that, well, this is crap. And I thought that many Americans felt the same way about him 
	and many of his peers. So I, with the help of my friends, designed this 
	"AuthorReplacementer 5000." See, [he picks up the Game Gear] this gadget can tell the 
	author by his or her writing style-
CROW: Or lack of same!
JOEL: And instantly project what the author would face if they were in ancient Greece.
CROW: Back when they still respected Art!
JOEL: So, I plugged in a copy of "The Pelican Brief," now let's see... [pushes several buttons
	on the Game Gear. He watches the screen and begins laughing] See, it seems they've
	sacrificed him to Apollo!
CROW: Oooh, ooh ooh, my turn! I'm going to go with a copy of Tom Clancy's latest rightwing
	Red Scare book, "Politika." Joel, if you will? [JOEL plugs in "Politika" where "The
	Pelican Brief" used to be, and hits some buttons. CROW watches and laughs at the
	result.] Oooh, seems like our friend Mister Clancy has been struck down by Zeus, as a
	punishment for going against the will of the gods! It's a riot!
SERVO: [to CROW] Yes, I know. [to camera] I decided to try a different route, and selected 
	Dalton Trumbo's excellent classic, "Johnny Got His Gun." Joel? [JOEL loads the book and 
	pushes the buttons. SERVO looks and nods] Yes, just as I thought. They made Mister 
	Trumbo an honorary scribe, Athena's left hand man! See? It works!
JOEL: So what do you think, sirs?

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: Mmmm... interesting... but, not half as fascinating as ours... Frank, if you will?

[FRANK comes in from offscreen. He is carrying what appears to be a camcorder and VCR in one.]

FRANK: I designed this latest invention... see, I was wondering, what if Freddy and Jason were
	to appear together in a movie that *wasn't* controlled by Hollywoods' big budget 
	titans.
DR. F: In other words, if they were to actually appear together in a RELEASED movie.
FRANK: Exactly. So I invented the CrossProjector. See, just grab a copy of the classic "Friday
	the 13th Part 8, Jason Takes Manhatten" [he puts that tape in the VCR] and the timeless
	"Nightmare on Elm Street, Part Three: The Dream Warriors." [puts that tape in the 
	camcorder] And look! [he looks into the viewfinder] [a pause] See? They killed each 
	other within four minutes! And Heather Langenkamp is nothing more than a
 	quivering, twitching, poorly-acted bloody mess! Wonderful!
DR. F: Yes, charming. [to JOEL] Well, time for Deep Hurting.

[SOL]

JOEL: Another Gamera movie?

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: Worse than that.

[SOL]

JOEL: Manos II?

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: Worse...

[SOL]

JOEL: You couldn't mean...?

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: A Ratliff Marrissa fic? But of course, my dear. I wish you, and your sanity, the best of
	luck. [to FRANK] Push the button, Franky.

[SOL, lights flashing]

CROW: [to camera] Say, could we see that CrossProwhozat for this Ratliff thing?
JOEL: It only works on horror movies! WE HAVE FANFIC SIGN!

From: Tv's Weretorgo <torgo@nettaxi.com>
Date: Sat, 14 Nov 1998 13:38:20 -0500

> 
> The Seventh Fleet

SERVO: Seven is a number used often in the Bible. Could it be that Ratliff is
	in fact making a serious statement about how Star Trek seems to shy away
	from organized religion?
JOEL: Mmmm... no.

> 
> Cast in order of appearance:

Joel: Red Alert! Brace for Ratliff Introductions!

> 
> Rear-Admiral Jean-Luc Picard    Commanding USS Enterprise
>                                         Commanding Third Fleet

SERVO: Three, as in the Trinity. I really believe that Steve-o is writing a
	veiled commentary on how religious matters are being shoved to the side or
	even negatively portrayed in Trek!
JOEL: I don't think so.
SERVO: No, really! This fanfic will be a symbolic battle between the
	religously faithful and the secular majority!
JOEL: I don't think so.
SERVO: Are the believers the bad guys for their fanatical intolerance for a
	world without open religion? Or is it the secularists who are evil, for
	imposing a system where individualism is undesirable and matters of faith
	are hidden?
JOEL: I don't think so.
SERVO: I'm deluding myself, aren't I?
JOEL: I think so.

> Lt. Clara Sutter                        Junior Assistant Chief Engineer, USS Enterprise

CROW: This sounds like a Dilbert title.
JOEL:  She was just promoted from Senior Assistant Secondary Chief Engineer in training.

> Lt. Cdr Marrissa Picard         First Officer, USS Stargazer

ALL:  [reciting in unison, dully]  ... Fighter Commander of the USS Stargazer, Lord High
	Admiral of Star Fleet Kids Crews, Princess and heir to the throne of Essex, and the
	greatest teenager in the history of humanity....
SERVO: So apparently there were no officers on the USS Stargazer before this fanfic?
JOEL: Yes, actually.

> Lt. Jay Gordon                  Second Officer, USS Stargazer
> Lt. Ross Lochard                        Chief of Security, USS Stargazer

CROW: Not a very good one if he lets little girls run around on the bridge.

> Lt. Katherine Lochard                   Assistant Fighter Commander, USS Stargazer
> Cpt. Sinclair                           Commanding, USS Armageddon
> Lt. Virginia Szustakowski               Chief Engineer, USS Stargazer
> Jacqueline "Jackie" Picard              Marrissa's sister (age 2)

SERVO: ...and Commanding Officer, USS Deep Hurting.
CROW: I see JFK's widow remarried *again*. Sheesh, and her name just keeps getting weirder, 
	too.


> Dr. Beverly Picard                      Mother of Jackie

JOEL: And good for nothing else.
CROW: In the Ratliffverse, any married female over 40 without "command" or "typing" skills 
	is officially demoted to "baby factory."

> Tom Cox                         The babysitter

JOEL: He had the title role in "Don't Tell Mom, Tom Cox is Dead."

> Rene Picard, jr                 Son of Isabelle and the late Rene Picard (age 2)

SERVO: Commanding Officer, USS Painful Story.

> Theresa Picard                  Aunt of Rene Picard, jr (age 5)

CROW: Rene Jr. later commanded a task force of the USS Hideous Fanfic, the
	USS Plotless Nonsense, and the USS Big Stinking Load of Crap.

> Lieutenant Williams                     Chief Engineer, USS Nimitz
> Cpt Greer                               Commanding, USS Virginia, later USS Nimitz

SERVO: Queer old Captain Greer, commanding the Nimitz.

> Cpt William T. Riker                    First Officer, USS Enterprise
> Cdr Data                                Second Officer, USS Enterprise

JOEL: This list isn't enough... anyone have a program? 

> Adm Victor Griest                       Asst Chief of Star Fleet Operations

SERVO: [as list ends] Never has there been a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
CROW: Now THAT's the kind of list we've come to expect from a Ratliff production.

> 
> Prologue

SERVO: Oh, God, we're only now just starting.

> 
>         The Enterprise-E felt empty without the children.

SERVO: No children?
JOEL: Must have been anti-Ratliff gas.

>							   That was a statement
> that Jean-Luc had never thought he would make.  He never wanted a command
> with families; not  that the Enterprise-E had as many as the Enterprise-D
> had had.

[silence]

CROW: [whining] My parser hurts!
JOEL: There, there... how about a baby aspirin when we finish?

>	  However with his own family gone, the ship seemed to be missing
> something.

CROW: Apparently when his wife left him she took the kids *and* the warp core with her.

>  He'd sent Beverly, Jackie, and Nicholas to live on Earth for
> the duration of the war.

SERVO: Nicholas ran away to Vegas to drink himself to death, and Jackie's husband was
	assassinated by a "lone gunman."
JOEL: One more JFK joke and we hit quota.





>			  The Rear Admiral had once felt that that a
> starship was no place for children.  Without his own, however, he prowled
> the halls of the Enterprise in search of something to

CROW: ...kill and eat.

>							 fill that hole in his
> life.

SERVO: Unsurprisingly, he found it in hard liquor.

>         Just three and a half, almost four, years ago, he would have never done
> this.  Then he had met and adopted Marrissa.  That young girl had changed
> him more than he would admit. 

CROW: After the lobotomy, he was powerless to stop her quest to become 
	queen of the multiverse. 


>				 He married Beverly Crusher, and together had
> now not one but two children, a cute little two year old girl who knew just
> how to get her way with her father, and a new born baby boy.  Beverly
> accused him of spoiling little Jackie,

JOEL: [as Beverly] You keep leaving her outside of the freezer!
SERVO: [as Beverly] And you never seal the plastic bag right!
CROW: [as Jean-Luc, henpecked] I just don't know how to use the Saranwrap, dear.

>					 but when that little girl looked up
> with her beautiful blue eyes and tossed back a wisp of her strawberry blond
> hair in a gesture that so reminded him of Beverly, he just had to cave in.

SERVO: [sighing] Now if only Marrissa's skull would do that.

>         Up ahead was the deck 20 rear observation lounge, a small lounge that was
> a good place to watch the stars go by.  It was where he use to

SERVO: USED! USED! LEARN TO SPEAK ENGLISH!
JOEL: [to SERVO] Now you're just overreacting.
CROW: Yeah, ignore the minor grammar errors and focus on the major plot errors.
SERVO: I just yearn for the days when the atrocious grammar and spelling
	distracted me from the sheer pointlessness of it all.


>								 find
> Marrissa when she was troubled back before she left her post as the
> Enterprise's Chief of Security to become first Fighter Commander, then
> First Officer of the Stargazer. 

CROW: A few commas would help... but where?
JOEL: How about "It was where he used to find, Marrissa, when she was a
        troubled back, before she left her post as the Enterprise's
        Chief of Security to become the first Fighter, Commander, then
        First Officer of the Stargazer."

[stunned silence for a second]

SERVO: Joel, please don't ever do that again.
CROW: Yeah, you overloaded my parser worse than Ratliff did.


>				 He'd stopped there every night since
> Beverly and the children had left.
>         This time it wasn't empty though. 

SERVO: [as Picard] Who put all these beer kegs in here? 

>					    Clara Sutter, his oldest daughter's
> best friend, was laying on one of the couches,

JOEL: Stoned out of her mind.

>						 and looking at the stars.
> "Mind if I come in, Clara?" Jean-Luc asked.

CROW: [as Picard] Because, you know, my wife left me and I've been feeling really lonely...
JOEL: Oh, Crow, don't go *there!* Yuck!

>         "Come right in Captain," Clara said, knowing his preference for not using
> his full rank unless necessary.
>         He took a seat on a nearby chair, and looked at the young lady. 

SERVO: [Pe-Pe LePew] Ooooh, if only she spoke French.

>									 Only
> thirteen years old, and an Assistant Chief Engineer on a starship, the
> Lieutenant had accomplished a lot.

CROW: Oh, come on. They only gave her that rank out of respect for their elders.

>				      Commander La Forge called her his most
> promising officer, a title he did not bestow often.  In fact, since La
> Forge had become Chief Engineer, only Wesley, Ensign Lefler, and Clara had
> been accorded that title.  Clara was normally a confident girl, she took to
> the Engine Room like she had been born into it. 

SERVO: Well, born *in* it, actually.

>						 In her element, she was
> unshakable.  Tonight however, she didn't look so sure of herself.

JOEL: [as nervous Clara] Gosh, I'd feel a lot better if there was a huge and
	nightmarishly complex generator barely containing colossal explosions in
	here.

>         "Troubled tonight, Clara?" Jean-Luc Picard inquired.
>         "Does it show?" Clara asked.

CROW: [as Picard] Of course not, Clara.. a little paint and some curtains, and
	it'll be hardly conspicuous.


>         "Not really," Picard replied.  "It's just that I find the people tend to
> visit this lounge when they need to think."

JOEL: [as smug, godlike Picard] I watch the people now and then. Sometimes
	their insignificant actions amuse me.

>         "Oh," Clara said.  After a moment's silence, she continued.  "I guess I am
> a little troubled.  I just heard that the Seventh Fleet is going to make an
> attack deep into Cardassian territory."

JOEL: Oh, you know, if little girls know about your operation it's a *good* sign that security
 	is blown.

>         "Worried about your best friend?" Jean-Luc Picard asked.

SERVO: [as Clara] Not really... she IS immortal and all. 

>         "A little," Clara said.  "I mean Marrissa's gotten in and out of battles
> before, but we're at war now, and before I've always been right there.

CROW: [as Clara] Cowering in the corner.


> I've never had to wonder how she was doing."

SERVO: [as Clara] Usually her ego was so large I could pick it up on a
	tricorder in a different star system.


>         "I'm worried about her too," Jean-Luc Picard said.  "I keep telling myself
> that she's a big girl now, First Officer of her starship.  She can take
> care of herself.

JOEL: [as Picard, read as poetry] That it's her party, and she can cry if she wants to, cry
	if she wants to, cry if she wants to.
CROW: In all fairness, you would cry too if it happened to you.

>		  Then I keep remembering how she was that first month
> after I adopted her, when ever comment put her in tears.

CROW: [as Picard] God, I hate teenagers.

>							   I remember every
> time she got hurt, and my mind starts imagining what could be happening too
> her. 

SERVO: [Picard] It makes me feel all tingly and warm inside.

>	 But I have to put that aside.

JOEL: [as Picard] Fun can wait.

>				       I am a starship Captain.  I have a
> ship and a fleet to command.  I can worry about her latter."

CROW: [as Picard] I'm pretty confident about her former, but her latter keeps
	me up at nights.

>         "So you do your duties during the day, and end up haunting the ship at
> night," Clara summarized.

JOEL: [as Picard] Yeah... until Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd started shooting me with proton
 	packs...

>         Rear Admiral Picard nodded and they lapsed back into silence.

SERVO: For those of you too stupid to follow the lack of action in this sequence, we 
	provide this convenient summary. Of nothing.

>									He turned
> toward the window, and for awhile, the two watched the stars streak by as

CROW: Audience: zero.

> 
>         The bridge of the Stargazer was in pretty good condition, all things

JOEL: [as Marrissa] What's this NPR crap? I want to hear 'Mmmmbop', and I want it 
	now!

JOEL: [as Captain] The maid hasn't cleaned yet, sorry about the mess.
CROW: Ahh, just throw a few throw pillows here and there, you'll never know the difference!


>	    Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard was in command, since

JOEL: [as Marrissa] What are their names?

JOEL: Just "Picard"? Not using a single one of her three dozen titles?
SERVO: I think it's like Prince. In the next fanfic she'll be represented by unpronounceable
 	ascii art.

CROW: [as a crew member] Yeah, I want to stay here and get killed.
JOEL: [as a crew member] I call dibs on being taken prisoner and tortured!

SERVO: [to JOEL] I didn't know humans had warp drive in the first place.
JOEL: [uneasily] Well, ahh, lemme tell you about the "birds, the bees, and Stephen Ratliff." 
	Later on, though.

>         "All ships, send a status report," Marrissa ordered. 

ALL: [in unison] All ships getting whupped, sir!

SERVO: [as Marrissa, ordering] Oh, and Jay, stand by to give tongue bath.

>         Marrissa turned back towards Jay and said, "I'm going to need Lieutenant

JOEL: How will linking panty shields help the situation?
CROW: Well, the deluxe models have wings, and a "new, improved barrier"
	for extra protection.


>         "She's on her way," Jay informed.  "It appears that our only problem of
> immediate concern on the fleet is the Armageddon's warp drive."

CROW: Ignoring the thirty enemy ships, of course.

>         "That's not going to repair itself," Lieutenant Ross Lockard stated.
>         "We'll find a way to bring them along," Marrissa stated as Lieutenant

SERVO: [as Marrissa] Since we'll probably need to justify the four-page cast list.

>         "Gina, if we were to run a group of ships between those two stars at say,

JOEL: [as Szustakowski] No, but if I get the wave machine from the swimming 
	pool on deck twelve... 


>         "You'd have to link up all the ship's shields, synchronize all the warp

CROW: Gaggh! Not synchronized Spaceship swimming!
JOEL: [deep, evil voice] And you thought it could not be done.

>						 but yes," Szustakowski said.
>         "Can we do it with the current ships and tow the Armageddon along,"
> Marrissa inquired.
>         "Towing the Armageddon makes it harder, but I think we can do it,"

SERVO: Well, sure, once you throw in some SciFi technodrivel and some typical Ratliffian
 	implausibility, it could happen.

>									     the

> "The Stargazer would have to lead, and we'd have to have three rings of

CROW: [as Gina] And I'll need some paper clips, a kazoo, some fresh gagh, a Popeil's 
	pocket fisherman, a spiral-cut ham, a towel and a pan-galactic gargle blaster.

>         "Get me that formation,"  Marrissa said.  "Open that channel again Jay. We
> may get out of this yet."

JOEL: [as Marrissa] Break the fourth wall, then we're *outta* Ratliff land!
CROW: [as Jay] But wouldn't that mean sacrificing every single one of your ten thousand ranks?
JOEL: [as Marrissa] Damn the approaching plausibility, full speed ahead!

>         "All ships are listening," Jay responded.

SERVO: [as Jay] Oh, except for that *one.*

>         "Ok, this is going to be tricky everyone," Marrissa began.  "We're going

JOEL: [as Marrissa] That's where I change into my dad's old Friday night outfit, then scare the
 	crap out of the enemy!

SERVO: So, what are the bad guys doing right now?

>         "Understood Stargazer," the Armageddon's captain replied.  "But if we
> don't make it to your formation in time, leave without us."
>         "That's a no go, Armageddon," Marrissa replied.  "I intend to take all of

SERVO: So the enemy has decided to wait around and not fire at the Stargazer 
	while they were thinking up this plan? 
CROW: Pretty much.

SERVO: Oh, I pick it up here and there...

CROW: Sometimes, however, it sent super-heated plasma into the warp core, causing a

	sub-atomic particles. But heck, you pays your money, you takes your chances.

SERVO: That's it? That's all we get for technobabble? Come on, let's reverse the field 
	polarity of the anti-matter induction coils, narrow the warp core's annular confinement 
	beam, and reconfigure the main deflector dish to send an inverted tachyon beam through

JOEL: On that cheery note...

[JOEL picks SERVO up and they leave]

[1...2...3...4...5...6... SOL]


[CROW is center, looking depressed. JOEL and SERVO are screen right and left, respectfully.]

CROW: I just can't believe it. All those planets, all those inhabitants, just gone. And you 
	know, I thought I felt a tremendous disturbance in the force. Did you guys feel a 
	disturbance in the force?

[SERVO blows a strawberry out of his dome at JOEL. JOEL catches it in a cup that already has 
some strawberries, milk, and ice cream in it.]

CROW: All those innocent lives . . . 
JOEL: Come on, Crow, who says they were innocent anyway? I mean, maybe they got what they 
	deserved.
CROW: What?
SERVO: Yeah, Crow. Suppose the fourth planet of one star contained a civilization of Pol Pots, 
	Stalins, and Hitlers? Aren't you glad they're gone?
CROW: Well, I guess I never really thought about...  [SERVO launches another strawberry. JOEL 
	catches this in his cup also.]
JOEL: [mostly trying to pacifate CROW] Of course you didn't. The third planet of the other star 
	was populated by Robert James Waller, the people who write those Chicken Soup for the 
	Soul books, the entire cast of Touched by an Angel, and everyone who thinks Family 
	Circus is funny.
CROW: [shudders] Wow, that's scary. So, you're saying maybe their destruction was a 
	good thing? [straightens up and looks a little more cheerful]
SERVO: Oh, absolutely. We haven't even discussed the fifth planet. I don't know if we 
	want to go there. [SERVO shoots another strawberry, JOEL catches this and puts the cup 
	onto a blender, turning it on to make a strawberry shake.]
CROW: No, come on guys, this is working. Let's hear about planet number five.
JOEL: Okay, if you must. Planet number five contained Robert McElwaine, Kathie Lee 
	Gifford, O.J. Simpson, Joe Eszterhaus, Pat Buchanan, Coleman Francis, Hal P. Warren, 
	Ludwig Plutonium, Martha Stewart, John _-_ Winston, Ed Wood Jr., John Tesh, Alexander 
	Abian, and every known recording of that Celine Dion Titanic song.
CROW: [Now looking positively perky] Wow! And Marrissa destroyed all that evil! 
	Thanks, Marrissa! [SERVO launches another strawberry at JOEL, not realizing that JOEL 
	no longer has the cup. It hits JOEL on the cheek.]
JOEL: Ouch. [rubs cheek where it hit] Servo, you're getting a little carried away. [yellow 
	light flashes] [to camera] We have commercial sign, we'll be right back.
CROW: [breaking mood] Hey, since when did you take up drinking strawberry shakes?
JOEL: Marrissa just makes them look *so* good. [Smacks light]

JOEL: Along with two stars, eleven planets, 27 moons, 3 sentient civilizations, and one

CROW: Well, "smelling," at least.

SERVO: [as Picard] It's almost as if, somewhere, some powerful being had control of all the 
forces in the universe, and manipulated them just for . . . nah, what am I *thinking?*


>         "Yeah, but sometime that has to run out," Clara said, pulling her hair

JOEL: [as Picard] Just keep telling yourself that, honey.

>         "I guess," Clara said.  "What brought you here?"

SERVO: [as Picard] Ratliff's need for Exposition and Character Development.

CROW: This makes "2001: A Space Odyssey" seem like a snappy series of one-liners.

household? What's your average combined yearly income? Approximately how many 
fanfics do you read each month? If you were offered a series of fanfics about a power-
mad adolescent ruling a world in which all adults are either inept or unconscious, would 
you be: A - very interested, B - somewhat interested, or C - suicidal? By the way, there *is* a 
right answer to all of these.

CROW: [as Beverly] Obvious child molester. Next?

CROW: [as Tom] From across the street, through a window, with binoculars... [quick beat] and a 
SNIPER RIFLE!

> I have a few questions to ask.  When does she have to go to bed? Does she
> have any medical conditions I should know about?

JOEL: A "few..." meaning, in this case, "two."

>         "Jackie goes to bed at 7:30," Beverly said.  "She can have a snack
> before hand, but not anything with vanilla in it.  She's allergic to it."

SERVO: [as Beverly] And she has tubes in her ears. And asthma, hay fever, an upper 
respiratory infection, scurvy, rickets, eromotic syndrome, Tarellian plague and a touch of 
the gout. She isn't allowed to get wet, and, oh, don't feed her after midnight. Just trust me 
on that one.

> 

CROW: An utterly pointless scene that is introduced awkwardly and exited
even more awkwardly. Classic Ratliff.


>        Jackie was playing with blocks.

JOEL: [as Jackie, dumb] Block taste like *wood!*

>				        She wanted to play with the dolls,
> but Theresa was, and wouldn't let her join in.

SERVO: But *Jackie* knew where Mommy's gun was.

>						  Rene would.  She liked her
> cousin Rene.  Together they were building a castle. 

CROW: See Rene. See Jackie. See blocks. See Jackie play with blocks. Rene sees Jackie play with 
blocks.

>						     Rene was much better
> at building things than Jackie.  Jackie's tower fell. 

JOEL: Ratliff's prose is so... descriptive... I'm overcome by his mastery of the English 
language.

>						       She stamped her foot
> once in frustration.

SERVO: --Knocking over *his* tower.

>         "It okay, Jackie," Rene said.  "Mine always fall."
>         "They not yet," Jackie said.
>         "They will," Rene said.

CROW: You know, I think *this* is the best scene in the entire fanfic. 
SERVO: I agree. 
JOEL: Yeah.
CROW: The dialogue is his best ever.

>         Jackie looked up from their creation.  There was man watching them
> that Jackie had never seen.  "Who that?"
>         "That Tom, babysitter," Rene said.  "He nice."

SERVO: [as Rene] Tell Jackie about the rabbits, Tom.

>         Jackie walked over to the man.  "You not 'Rissa" she said.

CROW: So, half the kids in the RatliffverseT are Nobel-prize-winning nuclear physicists, 
	and the other half are hopelessly inarticulate dopes.
JOEL: So, on average, everything's normal, then.
SERVO: Go stick one hand in a toaster and the other in an ice bucket, Joel. On average, 
	you're comfortable.

>         "No I'm not," the man replied. "I'm Tom. Who is 'Rissa?"
>         "She big sister," Jackie said.  "She my babysitter."

JOEL: Ratliff's idea of child dialogue - talk like a backwoods caveman.

>         "Not tonight, Jackie," Tom said.  "I'm watching Theresa, Rene, and
> you, while your mothers are out."

CROW: Whoa!
JOEL: Huge slam on Picard there!
SERVO: Excuse me while I go throw up all over myself.

>         "I want 'Rissa," Jackie said.
>         "I can't help you there.  I don't know where she is," Tom said.
> "Perhaps you can tell me about her."

CROW: [as Jackie] She want to be HU-man.

>         "'Rissa real smart," Jackie began.  "She number one on Stargazer.
> Has neat room.  No one order her.  She play with me.  Not hog dolls like
> 'Resa.  Dad worry about her.  Says she not know fear. 

JOEL: [as Jackie] Says all tremble before her.

>							I want to see 'Rissa."

SERVO: [as Jackie] She friends with author. Author make 'Rissa invincible.

>        "As I said earlier, I don't know where she is,"  Tom said in a
> mellow voice.  "Do you want me to see if we can get Theresa to share the
> dolls with you?"
>         Jackie shook her head yes.

JOEL: This completely gratuitous scene brought to you by Ratliff Productions.


> 
>         Marrissa was not feeling in her element.

CROW: They ran out of scum and filth.

>						   She sat at the head of the table
> in the fighter debriefing room.  It was the position of the person in

SERVO: And she's *not* feeling in her element?

>	  The other starship Captains were still moving around the room.
> The commander of the Nimitz had yet to arrive, and they weren't beginning
> until he did.

CROW: It'll probably be a while, since the captain has been dead for about 450
years.

>         This just left her sitting nervously in the chair at the head of the
> table.  She was only fifteen.  She was only a first officer,

JOEL: Fifteen and *only* a First Officer? Boy, good thing she didn't waste 
time going to the Academy, her career is going nowhere. 


>							      her Captain

SERVO: And with the medical technobabble generator still down, the prognosis was grim.

>			    With the exception of Lieutenant Williams, the
> Chief Engineer of the Virginia who had taken command after the Virginia's

CROW: So naturally, she's in charge of everyone else.

> She really didn't feel like sitting in her seat.  It felt wrong.

ALL: [in unison] Our feelings exactly.
SERVO: You know, after God-knows-how many stories that have landed her
imperious and totally perfect rump in that particular ivory throne, you'd
think she'd get used to it.


>								  She was

JOEL: [as Marrissa] No one's dead yet. I'm displeased.

>         Finally, Captain Greer of the Nimitz arrived.  He immediately took the

CROW: [as Greer] I'm not entirely sure those eunuchs carrying your throne
are allowed under Starfleet regulations, though...


>							    he said.  "I

JOEL: [as Marrissa] Gee, I get the feeling you're directing some *hostility* towards me.

>         "This is not how I planned on doing it," Marrissa said, as the other

SERVO: [as Greer] Oooh, noo, it'll go straight to my legs, really, you have it.

>         "Commander, you found a way out of a whole sale slaughter," Greer said.

CROW: It's a wholesale slaughter of savings, at Menards!

SERVO: [as Captains] More beer over here!

>         "In that case, I'd like a status report on each ship," Marrissa said.

CROW: [as Greer] I can't for the life of me figure out how all that strawberry juice got in

SERVO: [as Greer] I'll end my report by repeating the opening line. "I'm afraid the Nimitz is 
going to have to be abandoned."

>         "Lieutenant Williams, what's the status of the Virginia?" Marrissa said.
>         "We've lost our bridge, along with most of our command crew," Williams

CROW: [as Williams] We didn't need that part of the hull anyway.

JOEL: [as Williams, moronically] Speaking metaphorically, of course.

>         "No sir, I would not," Williams said.  "I can command in a pinch, but I

SERVO: [as Williams] Because, as stated earlier, I have security issues to work out.

>         "Captain Greer, after we're done, any person needing additional crew will

CROW: [as Marrissa] In the meantime, I'm sure our adversaries will appreciate us leaving a
mostly-functioning ship lying around!

>						  Anyone else have problems?"

JOEL: [as a captain] I...uh...can't openly express my love for my wife.

>         After a moment's silence, she continued, "Then I can expect all of your

>         "Commander, if the Virginia isn't above specs by the time you order us

SERVO: [as Williams] Plus 15% of the gross, *plus* a share of syndication.


>         "Okay, then at 0900 hours tomorrow morning, we'll depart," Marrissa said.
> "Taking a course towards Risa at warp 8 should bring us into contact with

> 

JOEL: [as Marrissa] So on that note let's wrap this scene.

[commercials]

> Chapter Four
> 
>         The Enterprise was under attack.  Four Jem'Hadar battleships were
> attacking her in concert. 

JOEL: And you thought *Kiss* was a show!

>			   Her only help was a trio of Excelsior Class
> ships, who were held up by a half dozen Jem'Hadar scouts themselves.

SERVO: [newscaster voice] Three Excelsior class starships were held up by a band of Jem 
Hadar scouts today. The scouts made off with four kegs of Romulan ale, six gallons of 
Saurian brandy, six liters of anti-matter, two cartons of tribbles and three cases of 
Tranya.
CROW: *And* a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster.
JOEL: [softly, an aside] And two hard boiled eggs.

>         Rear Admiral Jean-Luc Picard sat in his chair.  His expression was
> determined, no one was getting his ship.  Captain Riker was at the helm,
> taking the place of an injured ensign.  Data sat at Operations, unreadable
> as always. 

SERVO: [as Data, monotone] Drive not ready.  Abort, retry, fail?

>	    The Bridge was standing up well to the fight.  So far, no
> panels had blown. 

CROW: And no ensigns with odd names were killed yet. 

>		   Still, the dark red lit bridge of battle gave a sense of
> urgency.  It was deserved.  The Enterprise was shaking under fire.
>         "Shields at 42 percent, Admiral," the tactical officer said.
>         "Number One, hard to port," Picard ordered.  "Mr Data, any word on
> reinforcements?"

SERVO: [as Data] Yes, but the word is "unxious," so you won't get to use it a whole
lot.

>         "No sir," Data replied.  After a moment, he spoke up again.  "I'm
> detecting multiple warp signatures coming from Cardassian Occupied Space.
> At least a dozen."

JOEL: [as Picard] Is that a regular dozen, or a baker's dozen?

>         "We really could use those reinforcements now," Riker commented, as the
> Enterprise made a close pass over one of the Jem'Hadar battleships.

CROW: Why can't they just retreat? They don't seem to be guarding anything
important.

>         "Incoming call from the approaching ships," Data announced.  "Identified
> as the Seventh Fleet, lead by the Stargazer, Commander Marrissa Picard
> commanding."
>         "Put her on," Admiral Picard ordered.  Marrissa appeared in the
> holographic display beside the viewscreen.

JOEL: Hey! They stole our HexField Viewscreen!

>         "Need a hand, Dad?" Marrissa asked.

CROW: [as Picard, screaming/sobbing] GIVE ME BACK MY HAND!

>         "If you don't mind, Marrissa," Jean-Luc Picard said.  "It does look bad
> when the Federation Flagship is not winning the battle."

JOEL: [as Marrissa] Like I'll ever have that problem.

>         "It does?" Marrissa said.  "I'll remember that.

CROW: [as Marrissa] Now, get bent, old timer!

>							  Jay launch all fighters.
> Let me show you what my ship and the Seventh Fleet can do.

JOEL: Uh... next to nothing?

>							    Stargazer out."
>         On the Enterprise's main screen, the Stargazer decelerated from warp.
> Seven wings of Seven fighters

CROW: As I was on my way to St. Ives
      I met a fleet with seven ships.
      Each ship had seven bays.
      Each bay had seven fighters.
      Each fighter had seven torpedoes.
      Torpedoes, fighters, bays, ships,
      How many blow up at St. Ives?

>				 left her bays, their wings tipped red, blue,
> green, yellow, orange, purple, and black.

SERVO: Always color-code your files, receipts, floppy disks and fighter shuttles.

>					   All but the Black wing took up
> chase of Jem'Hadar scouts.  Black moved in to guard the Enterprise.  From
> behind the Stargazer, eleven more ships had come out of warp.

CROW:  And they had *how many* ships before the fanfic started?  120?
JOEL:  Sad, really.

>         The Ambassador Class starship Kentucky lead the Excelsior Class starships
> Hikura, Hermes and Churchill after one battleship. 

SERVO: Now *THERE'S* an effective usage of ship power.

>						    Anther battleship faced

SERVO: Edgar Allen Poe with a--
JOEL: Stop. Now.

>				  the Paris, and the Devin joined the
> Stargazer in an attack on the third battleship.  The Enterprise's Escorts,

SERVO: [perky female voice] All right, girls, let's escort the heck out of this
one!

>         "Commander Riker, move in on the ship that the Lee, the Perry, and the
> Patton are targeting," Admiral Picard ordered.

CROW: I wonder what'll happen when Ratliff runs out of famous American
generals' names to use.
SERVO: The USS Huey, the USS Louie, and the USS Dewey, that's what'll happen.

>         "Captain, the fighter wing is shooting down all incoming torpedoes," the
> tactical officer reported.  "Shields are beginning to regain power."
> 
>         A Jem'Hadar scout cut in front of the Enterprise,

SERVO: [as Picard] Hey, use your damn signal!

>							   the seven fighters of
> purple wing on it's tail. 

JOEL: [patronizingly] Today's crappy fanfic is brought to you by the number "seven."
CROW: --As in, the "seven" circles of HELL.

>			    The Enterprise fired on it.  One scout down.
> The wing turned toward the scout blue wing was chasing.  As they passed, it
> left seven lines of burning Jem'Hadar hull behind it.

JOEL: Spelling out "I was buzzed by a bunch of kids."

>						       Not all Federation
> weaponry was on the same settings.  Suddenly all over the battle field, the
> Federation fire got a lot more deadly.

SERVO: Someone *finally* took the weapons out of "please don't hurt me" mode and 
kicked them up to "mega-death." Now if Data can just figure out the game cheats...
CROW: How can Data type IDKFA without a keyboard?

>					  First it was the Virginia's target,
> then the Kentucky's, the one two explosions rocked the Enterprise back and
> forth.  One by one, the Jem'Hadar scouts died under fire of the fighters of
> the Stargazer. 

JOEL: After preparing for battle by watching countless martial arts movies, the 
Jem'Hadar came at the Stargazer in the tried and true "one at a time" fashion.


>		 The Enterprise, the Lee, the Perry, and the Patton

CROW: Hey, where's the ship named after Levy? Stephen, you anti-Semitic bastard.
SERVO: [automatically] We apologize on behalf of Crow, Trace, Weretorgo, and everyone else, for 
this potshot aimed at Mr. Ratliff.

> destroyed their designated battleship.

JOEL: As Marrissa makes a note to herself, "Turns out snuggling up to the enemy battle 
cruiser is a *bad* idea".

>								 but it's

SERVO: It made the mistake of pausing for a half-second trying to figure out
what the hell "impluse" meant.

CROW: Ohh, shouldn't have gone to that bean festival...

>         "All Jem'Hadar ships destroyed, sir," Data reported.  "Incoming call from

>         "On screen, Mister Data," Rear Admiral Jean-Luc Picard ordered.  "Let's

>         The bridge of the Stargazer appeared on the Enterprise's viewscreen.  To

JOEL: Ah, the subtle understatement weve come to expect in the work of Ratliff.

>							  The center helm

> Marrissa sat in the center seat.

SERVO: ...hastily stubbing out a blunt.

>				  Her hair was a mess and she had a small

CROW: Wow! Intense, sleeve-ripping action!

>						 Jay Gordon was intensely
> working at his console, ignoring the developing bruise on his head.

JOEL: After all, it didn't cause much *damage!*
SERVO: I knew that having his brain up his butt would prove advantageous sooner or later!

>         "Enterprise, this is the Stargazer," Marrissa said.  "I think we are going

>         "I'd be happy to provide on, Marrissa," Jean-Luc Picard said.  "I'll tell
> Starbase 367 to expect us.  Is there anything else you need?"
>         "No sir," Marrissa replied.  "I think we have everything pretty much in

CROW: [as Marrissa] Got some bruises over here, torn uniforms there, we ripped off a fender and 
dropped the tranny on that last run, we're burning oil and leaking anti-matter like you 
wouldn't believe, and of course most of the fleet's toast - yep, everything's under 
control.

>	 Just let me recover my fighters and we'll be ready to depart."
>         "Signal when you are ready, Marrissa," Jean-Luc Picard said.  "And have

> Picard.  The Stargazer had been towed in to dry-dock earlier in that day.

CROW: Ratliff never really explored the possibilities of that whole issue.

>	      The Stargazer would take three to six weeks before it was
> ready to return to service.

JOEL: Gee, it's a good thing it wasn't *totally* scrapped... it might take an extra *week* to 
fix!

>			     Those weren't the only reasons Griest was
> calling in the first officer of the Stargazer.  Moral was the lowest it had

CROW: So they thought they use Marrissa to make it even lower.
SERVO: The only way she's going to raise moral is if she's publically executed.

>		      Marrissa had public relations experience as a
> Princess. 

CROW: "She can wear a tiara like you wouldn't believe!"

>	   After her work with the Seventh Fleet, no one was going to call
> her anything less than a hero.  Star Fleet needed a hero.

JOEL: What we need is a few, good, heros.

>         Marrissa entered the room dressed in a neat uniform.  Her hair was pulled
> back with a Star Fleet approved gold barrette. 

CROW: If I had joined Star Fleet, completed the grueling coursework at Star Fleet 
academy, and prepared myself to explore the vast unknown expanses of the galaxy, I'd be 
just *thrilled* to be assigned to the barrette-approving department.


>						 It was a marked contrast to
> the tired teenager who commanded the Stargazer as it was towed into dock.

SERVO: Looks like Stephen's taken to author-insertation.

> She stood at attention in front of Griest's desk.  "Lieutenant Commander
> Marrissa Amber Picard reporting as ordered, sir."
>         "Commander Picard, are you aware of Star Fleet's opinion of your
> adventures in the Seventh Fleet," the Admiral asked.

JOEL: [as Marrissa] Yes, sir. 4% are impressed but frightened, 3% were rooting for the 
Jem'Hadar, 8% joined the Maqui, and 85% requested a transfer to the Delta quadrant, 
effective immediately.

>         "I just wanted to survive," Marrissa said.  "If Star Fleet thinks I
> deserve to be reprimanded for my actions, I am willing to be punished. 

CROW: [as Marrissa, seductively] *More* than willing. I brought my own horsewhip.

>									 I

>         "Commander Picard, we don't want to punish you for your actions," the
> Admiral said.  "In fact, Star Fleet has decided to award you the Medal of

SERVO: That does it. Joel, Crow, I'm going to go off and have a brief episode.

[SERVO exits left. Screams, taunts, bellows, whoops, and the like are heard.] 

>         "I don't deserve it, sir," Marrissa said.

JOEL: Just what *does* Marrissa deserve? Let's ask our studio audience.
CROW: I think she deserves to be bound, gagged, lightly beaten, then tossed into the brig 
and sent into the Gamma quadrant in a ship with just impulse power, a pet targ, and 
Wesley Crusher for company.
JOEL: No, the PETA folks would protest, and rightly so, that such a fate is too cruel for 
the poor targ. I'd like to see her tortured by one of those Cardassian pain implants, then 
forced to be the sidekick on the new, revived "Magic Johnson" talk show.

[SERVO returns from offscreen]

SERVO: You're both going too easy on her. I'd put her in charge of the customer 
complaints department at AOL.
JOEL: And when it's all done, she deserves to have Counselor Troi ask, "How do you 
feel about that?"

>         "Nonsense, you saved the remnants of the Seventh Fleet," the Admiral said.
>  "You are a hero."

CROW: [as Griest] In fact, lets just stop wasting time and elect you President!

>         "No, I'm not sir," Marrissa said, defiant and sadly.  "A hero would have
> saved them all.  A hero would have come up with some magical solution, not
> some old pirate trick she read about in Captain Pike's logs.  A hero's
> solution wouldn't have destroyed two stars."
>         "A hero's worse critic is himself," Admiral Griest said.

CROW: So then who do critics have for heroes?
SERVO: Leonard Maltin: Roger Corman. Siskel: the guy who invented Rogaine. Ebert: the guy who 
invented cheesecake.

>								  "Marrissa, you

SERVO: [as Griest] By which I mean tomorrow.

CROW: [as Griest] An Orion slave girl. I keep her chained in the basement.

CROW: This scene sounds strangely Japanese.

>         "Understood sir," Marrissa said stiffly.

SERVO: Ooops, looks like she had her mind on her pink panties again.

> 
>         Rear Admiral Jean-Luc Picard once again found Clara in the aft observation
> lounge.  She was still dressed in the scarlet evening gown she had worn to
> Marrissa's award presentation.  The silver tiara still held back her long
> dark hair.

JOEL: Even in the 24th century, no one can quite figure out "business-casual."

>         "What brings you here tonight, Clara?" the Admiral asked.
>         "Post Social Event Euphoria," Clara replied.

CROW: Don't you mean "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?"

>						       "I come back from them one
> of two ways,

SERVO: Drunk or unconscious.

>		 extremely tired or unable to get to calm down enough to do
> anything."

CROW: [as Clara] Though recently, I've found myself ending up in this crummy dump sputtering 
nonsense like I am now more and more often.

>         "It was strange to see Marrissa in a dress uniform," Picard said.  "I'm so
> use to her dresses at these types of events."
>         "You know, five years ago you wouldn't have seen her in a dress," Clara said.
>         "Oh?" Picard said.

CROW: [as Clara] Yeah, but *Jay,* on the other hand...

>         "Yeah, she swore off dresses when she was nine after a embarrassing
> gravity failure," Clara said. "Jay still brings up her pink panties every
> once in a while to poke some fun at her."

CROW: Ugh. I am *not* touching that!
SERVO: ICK!
JOEL: I need a bath.

>         "That explains Jay's comment at the Coronation Ball," Picard said.

SERVO: [as Picard, "adlibbing"] Because remember that he said that thing there?

>         "It's not as effective as it use to be," Clara said.  "Especially since
> Marrissa found a good comeback line."

JOEL: The immortal, "I know you are... but what am I?"

>         "I noticed that Jay looked uncomfortable tonight," Picard noted.

CROW: [as Clara] It was *his* turn to wear the pink panties.


>         "He's been having to run shotgun on Hurricane Marrissa," Clara said.

SERVO: Is that some kind of really freaky euphemism?


> "Apparently he kept Marrissa from going out in her personal fighter to chat
> with the other Captains of the fleet.  He's expecting Marrissa to get back
> at him somehow.  I happen to know that she doesn't plan on it.  In fact she
> has a lot more respect for Jay now that he's finally stood up to her."

JOEL: [as Clara] In fact, he's going to lead a perfectly safe life. In fact, nothing will *ever* 
happen to him, honestly, in fact.

>         "A good first officer must be willing to stand up to their Captain,"
> Picard commented.  "It's one of the first things I test when I get a new one."

CROW: [as Picard] I like my first officers pugnacious, argumentative, and insubordinate.

>         "I've been first officer for both Marrissa and Data," Clara said.  "I
> think I did okay, but I'm not so sure I'd have held for the long term like
> Captain Riker."

SERVO: [as Clara] Especially when I saw that requirement where I'd have to grow a beard
and gain weight.

>         "It's a position that you grow into," Picard said.  "New first officers
> tend to be timid and very rarely stand up for their beliefs, of course I
> don't think Marrissa will ever be like that.  Not any more.  She, like less
> experienced but not new first officers, has developed quite a bit of
> boldness.  Marrissa isn't the timid little girl I adopted anymore."

SERVO: [as Clara] That's because you actually adopted *Jackie.* Marrissa was
thrown through your window late at night.

>         "That's what you get for giving a girl her dream," Clara said.

SERVO: So that's the stuff dreams are made of? Nuking solar systems and blasting the 
enemy fleet, not to mention one of your own ships, into their component atoms?
JOEL: Well, I think that *is* how Shakespeare put it.

>									  She
> yawned.  "I better get to sleep, I'm in charge during Alpha shift tomorrow,
> and Commander La Forge prefers the duty Chief to be early."
>         "Good night Clara," Picard said as the young Assistant Chief Engineer

CROW: Just in case you still wondering what her rank is...

>										 left

> damaged USS Stargazer.

SERVO: [as repair man] Okay, now take that big roll of duct tape and wrap it around the hull
breaches. Wally, get the glue gun out for the new nacelle.

> 
>         Aboard the Stargazer, Marrissa pulled her curtains shut, cutting off the
> view of the dock and her father's ship.  She climbed into bed and fell
> asleep to the faint sounds of shipboard life.

CROW: Like "weeoo, weeoo," that humming noise, and "AAUUUGGH! IT'S EATING
MY FACE!"

> 
> The End.

JOEL: And another Ratliff fanfic draws to an illogical, inept, pointless close.
SERVO: I'm drained.
JOEL: Come on, let's go.

[JOEL picks SERVO up and leaves.]

[1...2...3...4...5...6... SOL]

[JOEL, CROW, and SERVO are sitting behind the desk.]

JOEL: [in the middle of a sentence] No, Servo, I disagree. I think Marrissa would kill her 
within, ooh, five minutes.
CROW: But what would her motivation be, Joel? Why would she do such a thing?
JOEL: Well, *duh...* Marrissa sees a queen, right?
BOTS: Yeah...
JOEL: Now, tell me, what is Marrissa's instinctive reaction to anyone holding a seat of power?
CROW: Umm, death, dismemberment, and removal from said seat?
JOEL: Of course!
SERVO: But would she not *ever* take into consideration any personal resemblance or likeness of 
the said power-holder?
JOEL: [after a seconds' thought] Nope.
CROW: Hmm...
SERVO: I don't care. I still disagree.
JOEL: I'll prove it.

[CROW and SERVO look startled]

CROW: [shocked] You don't mean...
JOEL: It's the only was to find out for sure. [smacks red button] Come in, sirs.

[DEEP 13]

[DR. F is onscreen]

DR. F: Yes, oh Big Bowl of Joel?

[SOL]

JOEL: Heh, real cute. Listen. Can you... [whispers something]

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: [amazed] You're crazy! Do you want to go MAD!?

[SOL]

JOEL: Well, isn't that the point of these movies and fanfics?

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: Well, yes, but... THIS?

[SOL]

JOEL: Just do it.

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: Well... if you insist... [pushes button on control panel.]

[SOL]

[Poof of smoke, and a throne appears. Clunk of DR. F hitting another button, and a short, fat, 
ugly redhaired woman is plopped on the throne. Another clunk, and a distant, offscreen door 
opens]

JOEL: [to BOTS] Now, just watch, as Marrissa views the Queen.

[Marrissa enters. She's a rather un-pretty young girl, very brattish.]

MARRISSA: [whiny] Hey, why the heck am I here? Man, MTV was just about to play that Spice Girls 
video... [to JOEL] Do you at least have any Strawberry--
CROW: [annoyed] No. Shut up.
MARRISSA: [whiny] BUT I DON'T *WANNA!* Man... [to JOEL] Do you at least have some salad 
cream... [trails off, sees throne.]
JOEL: [to BOTS] Just watch.
MARRISSA: [to Queen] Heyy... you're on a throne.
QUEEN: [in a very deliberate, annoying, raspy voice] Rule number one. When in my kingdom you 
shall hereby regard me as your *god.*
MARRISSA: [edgy] I don't think you want to say this...
QUEEN: You are *interrupting* my flow of power.

[for a second, MARRISSA is taken aback. Then, she slowly begins to smile]

MARRISSA: Mother!
QUEEN: [taken aback at first] What the...? oh my god... DAUGHTER!

[they embrace]

QUEEN: I knew the babies were switched, I knew it!
MARRISSA: That's what comes when you go to a Virginia hospital, mom.

[sinister, dramatic, yet heavenly music [basically, that means with a chorus] begins to play]

QUEEN: Now that I am reunited with my daughter...
MARRISSA: ...And I with my mom...
BOTH: Nobody shall undermine *our* power!

JOEL: My god! They've taken to one another! This can't be happening!
SERVO: Oh, but it is!

QUEEN: Now, daughter, we shall show those Trekkies a thing, or two, about CONTROL. First off. 
Do you know of a fellow named Jay?
MARRISSA: Oh, yes mom.
QUEEN: From now on he shall be my personal man-slave, eager to service all of my individual 
needs.
MARRISSA: But of course mom!

[music steadily grows louder]

QUEEN: We shall never be killed!
MARRISSA: Of course, mom! I'll give you access to the DNA labs of the Enterprise!

JOEL: Oh my GOD, she's messing with the hands of fate!

[music growing louder]

QUEEN: [almost shouting] We shall be forever present!
MARRISSA: And forever ruling!
BOTH: NOBODY... SHALL... OVERWHELM US!

[music almost deafening]

CROW: Joel, quick, DO something!
JOEL: I'm trying to think!

QUEEN: I love you, my daughter!
MARRISSA: I love you, mother!

[sudden explosion, as the music hits a cresando]

[smoke clears. Joel and the Bots are covered in a "canned-string"-like substance]

JOEL: [coughing] The sheer *pompousness* overwhelmed them!
SERVO: We're safe.
CROW: They hampered with the sod lo-mein.

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: [happily] Looks like we've learned a lesson.

[SOL]

JOEL: You bet we have. Never, ever, try to inflict pain on one's self! It's better to let one's 
evil oppressers do the pain-inflicting.

[DEEP 13]

DR. F: You're learning. [smiles, then pushes the button]
