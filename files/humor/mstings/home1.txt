1...2...3...4...5...6...*...

[Satellite of Love.  Mike, Crow, and Gypsy are at the counter.  
The board game "Life" is sitting on top of the counter.]

MIKE: Okay, now you spin the wheel, Gypsy.

[Mike spins the wheel for Gypsy.]

MIKE: You got a nine.

[Mike picks up the purple car piece and starts moving it.  Mike and
Gypsy both count up to nine.  In the middle of it, Tom Servo enters.]

TOM: Hey guys!  What have you wacky funsters got cooking over here?
MIKE: Oh, hey Tom.  We're just playing "Life" until the experiment
      starts.  
CROW: I didn't want to.  They made me.      
MIKE: Do you wanna play, Tom?  We just started.
TOM: "Life"?  The game of conservative propoganda?  No thanks!
MIKE: What are you talking about?
TOM: Well, just look at it!  This game *oozes* with '80s Reagan-era
     Republican values.  You start off with some money and you go
     to college.  Then notice that you *have* to get married
     and you *have* to get a job.  And it's hard not to end up with
     a family after that.  
CROW: Hey, you're right!  What's the *object* of the game?  To try to 
      live life as happily as you can?  No!  It's to play the stock
      market, retire, and count up your money.  Whoever dies with
      the most money, WINS!
TOM: Yeah!  Where's the square that says, "You join a improvisational
     theater troupe.  Move forward 3 spaces"?
CROW: Or maybe I just wanna take my little green car --
MIKE: You're the blue one, Crow.
CROW: Yeah, uh, take my little blue car and roam the open roads... 
      <wistfully> the wind through my hair, tunes on the radio, 
      lookin' for adventure, and not a care in the world!
MIKE: Okay, so how would you change the game?
TOM: Well, first of all I'd make it so that you wouldn't have to
     get married if you didn't want to, or that you could marry
     either sex.

[The other three look at Tom funny.]

TOM: What?

[They snap back to reality.]

MIKE: Right.  Marriage optional.  <He scribbles on the board>
TOM: In fact, just get rid of that church altogether. 
MIKE: <rips out church piece> Maybe we could replace it with a 
      mosque later.  What else?
CROW: Next, take money out of the game.
MIKE: <starts collecting all the money, throws it out> Okay.  But
      how do we know who wins?  
CROW: You don't.  Nobody wins.  We just die.
TOM: It'll be a lot more like real life that way.
MIKE: But where's the fun in that?
TOM: Fun?  Real life isn't fun!  Real life is full of pain and
     suffering!
CROW: In fact, let's add a few more squares to that effect.
TOM: "Mother dies.  Lose a turn."
CROW: "Job market dries up.  Move back in with parents."
TOM: "Boss sexually harasses you.  Pay $500 in legal fees."
MIKE: All right, that's enough!  Leave it to you guys to turn a 
      light-hearted game into something dark and cynical.
CROW: Hey, just telling it like it is, Mike.

[Mads' light begins flashing.]

MIKE: Oh great, Dr. Demento is calling. <pushes button>

[Deep 13.  Dr. Forrester is in front of the camera, laughing evilly.]

DR.F: Not even your peurile antics can ruin my good mood today, 
      Mike Nelson of the North!  You see, I've decided to go for
      the jugular with today's experiment.  Remember "Enterprized,"
      hmmm?  Remember "A Gul's Revenge?  <laughs>  Well, my sources
      have dredged up another shipwreck of a fanfic from that master
      of disaster, Stephen Ratliff!

[SOL.  Tom is (unsuccessfully) trying to stick his head in a microwave
and turn it on.  Crow is sucking on a straw that is in a bottle
marked "Poison."  Mike is humming while he arranges a noose.]

MIKE: <looking back at camera> Oh, don't mind us.  As you were saying?

[D13.]

DR.F: No, no, no, don't pass out on me now!  I want you fully not-dead
      for this experiment!  Try and wade through the muck that is "Away
      From Home"! <pushes a button>

[SOL.  All equipment of death has disappeared.  Lights and buzzers are
going off.]

ALL: AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  WE GOT RATLIFF SIGN!!!

>                       ~~~~~~~~

TOM: <sobbing>
MIKE: Come on, guys, he hasn't spelled anything wrong *yet*.   We can 
      get through this.

> 
> Personal Log
> Marrissa A. Flores

CROW: <whimper> Bite me, Marrissa. <sniff>

> STARDATE 45924
> 
>       Upon my mother's suggestion, I am beginning this log to, as my
> mother says, record my activities, my goals, my hopes, and my dreams.

MIKE: My first goal is to get my mom to stop bossing me around.

>       I am 10 years old.  I live on the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D.  

TOM: ...and I'm a Vice-Admiral in Starfleet.

> My parents are both security officers, Mom being an ensign and Dad a
> Lieutenant.  My parents met and married at Starfleet Academy San
> Francisco on Earth where I was born.

CROW: In fact that's why they had to get married.  
MIKE: Since then, they've led loveless, bitter lives.

>       The biggest event in my life was being trapped in the turbolift
> with Captain Picard.  This earned me the nickname "Number One."

MIKE: <gestures to the bots> Not a word, either of you.
CROW: I wasn't gonna say anything...

>       Tomorrow my Computer Development class will be visiting the
> Daystorm Institute Expansion on Archer IV.  I'm not exactly happy about
> having to retake this class.  

TOM: That's what you get for being on the "five-year plan."

> Personally I find this class boring an humiliating.  

CROW: <Marrissa> I hate it when they make me wear the dunce cap.

> Boring because I have heard it all before, Humiliating
> because I'm stuck in with a bunch of eight year olds.  

TOM: So Ratliff's child prodigy Marrissa flunked a third-grade class?  
CROW: <snicker>

> It wouldn't be
> so bad if it weren't for the two engineering geniuses, Clara and Shayna.

MIKE: They're always blowing the curve.
TOM: You know, Ratliff has a lot of strong female characters. You think 
     there's something he isn't telling us?
CROW: Maybe... but that doesn't mean he's James Cameron.

> Clara's not so bad ... in fact given time I think we could become
> friends.  But Shayna's never-ending practical jokes are getting on my
> nerves and we have only been in the class two weeks.

TOM: Awww, are the big bad 8-year-olds bullying poor Marrissa?

> 
> Close Personal Log.

MIKE: Thank God.

>       The mischeavious Shayna Sachs was the first to arrive at the

> 
>       Pilot : Ens. Throwaway  Co-Pilot : Lt. Allen

TOM: Ensign THROWAWAY?!
MIKE: Maybe Ratliff asked somebody's advice on the script and
      that was the answer.
CROW: Guys, he's not even *trying* anymore.  If he ever did.

>       Left                    Right

TOM: Ladies and gentlemen, your 1996 presidential candidates.

> 
>       She quickly went a placed something on a couple seats 

ALL: Ewwww!

> and sat down to wait.
>       Jay Gordon was next to arrive followed by Clara Sutter and the
> rest of the class.  At the end of the line was Marrissa, carrying
> several PADDs and a tricorder.  She sat down - on a whoopi cushion.

CROW: In space, no one can hear you --
MIKE: CROW!
TOM: Ah, the wonderful tunes of "Sister Act"...

>       Everyone laughed 

MIKE: ...except the readers.

>                        and Marrissa glared.  The Lieutenant who taught
> the class arrived and entered the shuttle.  As he pasted Marrissa, 

ALL: YAY!!  Paste her again!  Hit her harder!

>  she handed him the whoopi cushion.
>       As he reached the cockpit he turned and said, "Behave on this
> trip or there won't be any more."  

CROW: I'll turn this shuttlecraft RIGHT AROUND and... wait, we haven't 
      left yet.

> He turned back into the cockpit and
> sat down in the Co-Pilot seat ... on a whoopi cushion.  

TOM: Humor - Ratliff style.  Big and chunky.

> The Lieutenant
> looked up at the ceiling and shoke his head, while removing the
> offending item.

MIKE: If he takes his head off, how is he going to command?

>       Ensign Throwaway ente4red the shuttli and sat down.  

CROW: ...aparrently causing the spellchecker to explode.

> The rear of
> the shuttle closed and Lt. Allen said, "Shuttle April to bridge, Request
> permission depart for Archer IV from Shuttle bay Two."

TOM: <Data> Lieutenant, your universal translator seems to be malfunctioning.

>       "Bridge to Shuttle April," Commander Riker's voice said.
> "Permission granted, now relaying departure coordinates."

MIKE: <Lt. Allen> Uh, that would pretty much have to be *here*, commander.

>       "Coordinates received," Ensign Throwaway announced. "Shuttle bay
> doors opening." 

CROW: <Riker> I *know* that. We control them from here, you know.

>       "Depart when ready, Bridge out."

TOM: Please use detour.

>       "Leaving shuttle bay 2 now,  April out," Lt Allen said.
>       The shuttle moved out of the shuttle bay, between the warp
> engines.  

CROW: So the shuttle is leaving, then?
TOM: Yep... pretty much.

> It turned right and slightly down and went in to warp.

MIKE: ...crashing into a warp nacelle.

> 
>       The shuttle craft April from the USS Enterprise was traveling
> along at warp 2 when a phaser bolt shot across it's path 

CROW: I hate those random phaser blasts.

>                                                          and over the
> communications channels -- all of them -- came the message, "Heave to and
> prepare to be boarded."

TOM: Arrr, surrender, ye scurvy dogs!  We'll throw ye out the airlock!

>       Lieutenant Allen ordered, "Take us out of warp in that solar
> system."  He indicated a nearby G-class star-system with a M-Class
> planet.

MIKE: Plot Convenience Theater presents...
TOM: I'm sensing a subliminal Oldsmobile ad, guys.

>       "Lieutenant, this system has a large amount of background
> radiation," Throwaway said.

CROW: Of course.  It wouldn't be TNG without subspace interference.

>       "Will transporters be blocked?" Allen asked. 
>       "If we get closer, yes," the Ensign replied.
>       "Would landing on the planet be sufficant?" Allen inquired.

MIKE: No, it wouldn't, Todd.  I'd be deeply hurt.

>       "Confirmed."
>       "Set a course to land on the planet," Lieutenant Allen ordered.
> "Engage when ready, best possible speed.  

TOM: <Throwaway> Well, I was going to go at worst possible speed, but
     since you insisted...

> Computer open the distress channel."
>       "Channel open."
>       "This is the Shuttle craft April from the USS Enterprise.  We are
> under attack from an unknown vessel in system N178278.  

ALL: ...378478578.

> Request

CROW: Like, oh, maybe, THE ENTERPRISE??

> Allen said.  "Computer, append scan of vessel and repeat message until
> we are cut off.

TOM: Hey, they're spamming!

>       After a couple minutes 

MIKE: ...during which the enemy ship kindly refrained from doing anything...

> it announced, "Transmission blocked after 4 repinions.  

TOM: Re... huh?
MIKE: How many calories in a repinion?
CROW: I don't know, but they sure give me gas.

> Enemy vessel is jamming all channels."
>       "That was not a good idea," the enemy vessel transmitted. "Now
> we will have to destroy you ."

TOM: We weren't *going* to destroy you, but now we *have* to.

>       "Ensign prepare for evasive maneuvers," the Lieutenant
> responded. 

MIKE: <alien captain> Don't order me around like that!

>       The shuttle moved toward the planet.  It dodged left and right
> the purple phaser bolts of the enemy vessel.  

TOM: <singing> For purple phasers' majesty, Above the fruity plots...

> As it neared the planet 
> the emeny scored an glancing shot on the impulse engine. 
>       "Lieutenant, I've lost helm control," Ensign Throwaway
> announced.  "We are going to crash land."

CROW: ...and I'm wearing the Ratliff equivalent of a red shirt!
MIKE: You mean he's over 15?
TOM: Build music!  Zoom on face, soap-opera style!  Fade to commercial!!

> 
>       Back in the cabin panic reigned.  

CROW: In fact, it poured.

> Then into the chaos the shy Marrissa's voice rang out.  

TOM: <timidly> Um... ring?

> "Take your seats.  If you sit down, turn
> around and shut up then we will get though this."

MIKE: She is, of course, referring to the bulkhead.

>       Meanwhile in the cockpit things were improving.  

CROW: Things?
MIKE: Yeah, you know... things.

> "We are regaining helm control," Ensign Throwaway announced.  

TOM: The ship is magically repairing itself!

> Then all the sudden things got much worse.  

CROW: The story continued.

> A purple bolt hit the shuttle sending a
> pulse of electricity shot thought the hull hitting the Starfleet
> officers.  They slumped over the console, dead 

ALL: <laugh>
MIKE: Well, *that* was a precise shot.  And a convenient plot device, too.
TOM: Yeah, I can see why the cokcpit-on-the-hull design never caught on.

>

>                       ~~~~~~~~~~~
> 
>       In the Cabin of the Shuttle April, Shayna noticed the crew's
> death and sweared.  

CROW: Then she reckoned she had to light out for the west.

> Clara fainted. The boys were stunned.

TOM: Quite frankly, so are the readers.

>       "We are going to die," Alexander moaned, unklingon-like.
>       "No, you are not," Marrissa said, calmly yet loudly.  

MIKE: When Marissa screams, it has a soothing effect.

> "Jay what
> was the name of the game that the teacher took from you last week?"

CROW: You mean Virtual Vanessa?

>       "Shuttle Diasters, Why?" Jay replied.

TOM: Well, it's realistic, at least.  Whenever Starfleet uses a 
     shuttlecraft, it crashes.

>       "Take the helm," Marrissa said.  "I saw your high score, and i
> know you can land us safely.  

MIKE: And of course, we all know that computer games are better than 
      training and actual experience.
CROW: By that logic, I can get a pilot's license if I play "Microsoft 
      Flight Simulator" a lot.

> Alexander from what I have over heard you decussing with Jay, 

TOM: Boy, these kids swear a lot.

> I think you would make a good co-pliot for him.  Now
> snap to it." Jay and Alex took off for the cockpit.  "Shayna stop
> swearing, its unlady like.  Try to revive Clara."
> 
>       In the cockpit, Jay and Alexander pushed the dead bodies aside

MIKE: <boyish voice> We eat tonight!

> and took the controls.  

CROW: Hey!  Where's the SHIFT key?  I can't fire without the SHIFT key!
      Where's that darn game manual...

> "Alex try to level us off," Jay ordered.  "I'll
> try to steer us down safely."

TOM: <laughs> They're goners.
MIKE: Naw, this is a Ratliff story.  Not only will they survive, but 
      they'll all be promoted to Commander.

>       "Angle of decent, cut to 60 degrees," Alexander said.  "6
> thousand meters."

CROW: <British> Note they do not so much fly as plummet.

>       "Try to cut it to 30 by 3 thousand," Jay said as Marrissa and
> Shayna entered the the cockpit and removed Lt. Allen. 

TOM: <Minnewegian voice> Ooh, he'll go so nice with the tomatoes I picked
     in the garden today.

>       "3 thousand meters, angle of decent 28 degrees," Alexander said.
>       "Level us off at 15 hundred and begin looking for a landing
> site," Jay said.  Marrissa and Shayna returned to the cockpit to remove
> Ensign Throwaway.  

MIKE: You know, I'm gonna miss Ensign Throwaway.  Such character development.

> "Any suggestions for a landing site, Captain?"

TOM: How about the ground?

>       "Some place with a water sorce and burnable vegation nearby,"

CROW: <Beavis> So we can burn stuff... heh heh... fire.. yeah...

> Marrissa said.  "Shayna you take the feet this time."  As they began
> moving the Ensign back into the cabin she continued.  "By the way Jay,
> when did I become Captain to you?"

TOM: <singing> First time, ever I saw your face...

>       "When you took cammand a few moments ago." Jay replied.
>       "That makes me Captain?" Marrissa asked.
>       "The commander of any vessel has the right to be called
> Captain," Jay replied.  "Alex height and angle of decent?"

MIKE: About 4'3" and it depends on who I'm dancing with.

>       "1613, 10 degrees," Alexander replied.
>       "I will have to take command more often," Marrissa said.

CROW: <Marrissa> Hmmm... I *enjoy* dominating men...

> "Please land us as so as you find a spot.  Its easier to spot an moving
> shuttle than a hunk of metal on a planet."

TOM: Of course, it's a lot easier to *hit* a hunk of metal...

>       "Now changing coarse, bearing 256," Jay said.  "I'm bringing us
> down."

MIKE: This whole fanfic is bringing us down.

> 
>       Moments later jay was bringing the shuttle down on a lake side
> beach.  

CROW: So you say he's bringing down the shuttle?

> Although the landing was a little rough, Jay tore up 20 feet of beach, 

TOM: Not bad, considering shuttles are about 30 feet long.

> the shuttle came though it with little additional damage.

MIKE: Except for Marissa, who went through the windshield.

>       The cabin was quiet after the landing.  The childern 

CROW: Dern those childs!

> looked unharmed, if a little shaken.  "Clara, hand me my tricorder," 
> Marrissa said.  

TOM: Get it yourself, bossy.

> Clara handed Marrissa the instrument and Marrissa scanned though
> the wall of the shuttle.  "The atmostphere is breathable in fact it's
> almost perfect outside. 

MIKE: Well, of course!  Did you expect *variety* on Star Trek?

> Open the door."
>       Shayna hit the code and the rear of the shuttle opened up.
> Outside the sky was a clear blue.  The beach  was of yellow sand .  Off
> the beach there a lot of purple leaved trees.  In fact it was a regular
> forest of purple.  

CROW: Yep.  Purple trees would imply a purple forest, I guess.

> The ground cover was as thin bladed grass greenish
> blue in color.  Beyond the clear blue lake were purple tree covered
> montains.  

TOM: So Ratliff only has one gel for the lights, I take it?

> Clara and Shayna stood amiring the view.

MIKE: We could destroy all this and build condos!

>       "I hate to interupt you, but we better get ready to move away

CROW: And our musical guest, Alex and the Phasers!
ALL: <crowd noises>

> Clara, I want 2 days meals for each of us in backpacks.  

TOM: <Clara> But what if we're stranded here for more than two days?
CROW: <Marrissa> Shut up and do what I say!
MIKE: This was supposed to be a one-day field trip!  What are 30 meals
      doing in the shuttlecraft?

> Shayna ready all the booby trapping materail you can find.  

CROW: Booby trapping material??
TOM: Standard Starfleet issue.  There should be a clearly marked box.

> I want the shuttle tarp to annoy
> the guys who fired on us but with stuff we can remove without harming
> ourselves."
>       "What will you be doing Captain?" Jay asked.

MIKE: <Marrissa> Trying to figure out what the hell I just said!

>       "Downloading all the information I can into a tricorder,"
> Marrissa replied.

CROW: There's a lot of stuff in the alt.binaries newsgroups that's a *lot*
      more important than the other 3 weeks worth of food!

>       "Why not a PADD?" Jay inquired.
>       "Listen in class next time," Marrissa said.  "Before he took
> your video game, Lt. Allen explained that PADDs only have 16 hours of
> use."

TOM: Then you have to get new AAA batteries.

>       "What about Lt. Allen and the co-pilot?" Jay asked.

MIKE: They now have zero hours of use.
CROW: Yeah, grab their wallets and ditch 'em.

>       "Put them in body bags and hide them in the woods," Marrissa
> said.  

TOM: <Jay> What about a decent burial?  And their wives and families?
CROW: <Marrissa> Screw em!  I'm in charge now!!

> "That is you and Alexander's next job.  Thank you for volenteering, Jay."

ALL: <trumpet noise> Wah wah waaahhh....
MIKE: Hope these kids have never seen "Alive."

> 
>       A half-a-hour later, the children gathered in front of the
> shuttle.  

ALL: grumble grumble mutiny grumble...

> During thier perparations they discovered a stream in front of 
> the shuttle.

TOM: My God, I just realized we're standing in a stream!
CROW: A stream of *what*, they weren't sure of.

>       "In order to avoid capture we will be finding a new shelter,"
> Marrissa began.  The detailed survey of this planet tells me that this
> stream's sours 

MIKE: It's a lemonade stream!  They landed in Willy Wonka's chocolate 
      factory!

>                is a cave about a half a mile from here.  We will shelter

TOM: And we'll have only life-signs, power sources, footprints, and logic 
     to give us away.

>       The five children then picked up thier bags and headed upstream

CROW: So, has anyone here read "Lord of the Flies"?

MIKE: ...too quiet.

>                                              when the call came in. 
> Deep in Federation Space no one expected anything to happen.  

TOM: ...except for the space-time anomalies that happen every week.

> In fact Doctor Crusher was in command 

CROW: Apparently, all 1400 other crewmembers were on shore leave.

TOM: Paperwork?  
MIKE: Must be tax time again.

>       At Tactical a young ensign announced, "In coming distress call,

> Noticing that the tactical officer was standing shocked she asked,

CROW: "You forgot to unplug the toaster, didn't you?"

> "What's wrong, Ensign."
>       "That's the field trip shuttle," the ensign said. "My daughter's

TOM: <ensign> I've never been so happy in my life!

> 
>       On the planet which the shuttle had landed on, her daughter was

>       "How much farther?" Shayna asked.
>       "Not much farther," Marrissa replied.
>       "You are enjoying this, Marrissa, aren't you," Jay observed.

MIKE: You're on a huge ego-inflated power trip, aren't you.

CROW: It distracts them from their pathetic lives.

> "I recommend Yellowstone and Yosemite on Earth for camping.

TOM: Oh, Ratliff idolizes "Star Trek V".
CROW: That would explain a lot.

>       "You expect up to stay overnight?" Jay asked.
>       "Yes, the Enterprise is a good couple hours away, minimum,"
> Marrissa replied.  "It will be dark in an hour."

MIKE: And the nights only last 30 minutes on this planet.

>       "How much farther?" Shayna asked.

>       Alexander was standing between two trees.  

TOM: Amazing, considering he's in a forest and all.

CROW: Apparently, you *can* get water from a stone!

MIKE: Since when is a degree a unit of measurement?

TOM: What, you think it's going to leave?

CROW: Just order from room service.

CROW: Ha ha!  It's funny, cause it's... chemical warfare...
MIKE: It's a good thing all shuttlecraft carry chemical weapons.
TOM: You think they'll try Marrissa as an adult?

MIKE: Saves on funeral expenses, I guess.

TOM: Ha!  Those wacky aliens don't even know which seat to use!  Ha ha!

MIKE: This is like "Home Alone 2," only much more disturbing.
TOM: Come on guys, let's bail.

[Mike picks up Tom and they leave the theater.]

1...2...3...4...5...6...*...

[SOL. Crow and Tom are behind the counter.  Crow's hair/web is 
glowing bright red.  There is a rope hanging from the ceiling that 
ends just above the counter.]

TOM: Okay, is everything ready?
CROW: I think so.  This is gonna be so great!
TOM: How's your web?  Is it hot enough?
CROW: Oh yeah, definitely!
TOM: <giggles> Oh boy!  Sshhhh!  Here he comes!

[Mike enters from off-screen.  He walks behind the counter and suddenly 
slips and falls.  The bots start laughing.  Mike slowly gets back on 
his feet.]

MIKE: All right, now who put all those marbles on the floor?
TOM: <snort> Gee, I don't know! <stifled laugh>
CROW: Say, Mike... I was wondering if you could touch my web?
MIKE: <confused> Well, all right...

[Mike grabs Crow's hair.  A sizzling sound is heard, and smoke comes from 
Mike hand.  Mike screams, and the bots break into laughter again.]

MIKE: Hey!  That really hurt!
CROW: I guess you have the *hot hand*!
TOM&CROW: <renewed laughter>
MIKE: Stop laughing!
TOM: Hey Mike, would you mind pulling that rope there?
MIKE: Why?
TOM: Just pull it and find out!

[Mike pulls the rope.  A large metal girder swings down from another
rope and hits Mike smack in the face.  The bots laugh harder than than 
they ever have in their whole lives.]

MIKE: <holding his nose>  I tink my dose is broken!
TOM&CROW: <keep laughing>
MIKE: Oh god, I'm in so much pain!
TOM&CROW: <laugh, laugh, laugh>
MIKE: I need to get the first aid kit...

[Mike walks off-screen.]

CROW: Hey, Mike, just don't open the medicine cabinet!

[A creak is heard as Mike opens the medicine cabinet.  Then several
rounds of loud gunfire are heard, as if from a machine gun.  Tom and 
Crow laugh again.  Gypsy enters.]

GYPSY: What is going on in here?  I heard a gun!
CROW: Oh Gypsy, you missed all the fun!
GYPSY: What have you done to Mike?
TOM: Just a few harmless pranks!
CROW: Yeah, it's all in good fun!

[Cambot zooms in on Gypsy.  We can't see Tom and Crow anymore.]

GYPSY: Oh my god, you might have killed him!  *Then* where would you be?

[Cambot pulls back again.  Tom and Crow have their hands on the sides of 
their faces, Macauley Culkin-style.]

TOM&CROW: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

[Sirens and buzzers go off.]

ALL: FANFIC SIGN!!


6...5...4...3...2...1...*...

[Mike, Crow and Tom enter the theater.]

TOM: No hard feelings, Mike?  We were just having a little fun.
MIKE: Yeah, well, it's a good thing I heal fast.  And next time,
      don't imitate everything you see on TV, okay?

TOM: <Marrissa> I'm burning out at age 10!

TOM: <Riker> Damn these plot devices!

CROW: You should be used to it by now.  The Enterprise is *always* the

TOM: Just out to the suburbs.

MIKE: Good, I don't want to be with those cootie-covered girls.

MIKE: Heh heh, no bodies, no juvenile court.

TOM: Run away!  Run away!

TOM: Ach, ya, they are little girlie aliens.
MIKE: It's a good thing they had those cheat codes for God Mode!

CROW: Mr. B Natural ought to hold them off for a while.

TOM: Mommeeeee...
MIKE: Something tells me the Trakcen miscalculated their invasion strategy.

CROW: Um... shouldn't you get an *experienced* pilot to the surface first?

TOM: Heh heh.  *This* oughtta be good.

>       "Jay says he and Alexander can bring us in," Marrissa said.

MIKE: They've been dropping acid since lunch.  They're pretty sure they 
      can lift the shuttle over their heads, too.

CROW: The other kids really beat the crap out of her.

ALL: <groan>
TOM: That's more information than I needed, thanks.
MIKE: Suddenly it's "My So-Called Life."

>       "Thanks for the warning, I'll rearrange my schedule."

CROW: Oh, like Troi can preach on this subject.
TOM: <Troi> Drown your troubles in chocolate, Marrissa.

MIKE: No, I just called you a worm.

CROW: I need you to check the grammar.

TOM: ...shouldn't have to finish our sentences.

MIKE: The Captain should remember that rule more often.

CROW: ...it stinks!

TOM: This ain't Amsterdam, honey.

MIKE: ...in a reassuring monotone.

>       Marrissa nodded.

CROW: ...except when he's excited.
TOM: And he *is* housebroken now.

MIKE: That has whole other connotations that I won't get into.

>       "That's not what I'm worried about," Marrissa said.
>       "What then?"
>       "I'm not good at oral presentations.  I calm up.  

CROW: <Marrissa> My hands get all dry, and I stop shaking...

TOM: Heh!  Now we know what grades Ratliff gets over at Radford U.

>       "It is when you are a strait A student.  May be you should talk

>       "Perhaps I will," Troi said.  

MIKE: <Troi> Is he single?

> "Meanwhile you might want to think

CROW: Especially with Will.... mmm...

>       "They do look like that," Marrissa laughed and Troi joined in.

TOM: Uncomfortable, constricting pajamas that decrease your chances of 
     having children, maybe.

MIKE: <Picard> Remember - with feeling!

CROW: Then she examined the fiscal outlook for the next quarter.

ALL: <raise hands> Ooh!  Me!  Me!
TOM: Why do you keep saying "analyst" when you mean "analysis"?

>       "Is it possible that the Trakce wanted to help you?" the Doctor

>       "I doubt it doctor," Marrissa replied.  

MIKE: <Marrissa> You are *so* naive.

> "You don't beam down on

CROW: If Marrissa's on it, that's all the reason *I* need.
TOM: Um... and they didn't beam down, anyway.  They flew down in a shuttle.

>       "I agree," Worf said.

MIKE: <Worf> There, I've said my line.  Now I can get back to my needlepoint.

>       "The chances of the Trakce shuttle doing having no hostile

CROW: Our chances of enjoying this fanfic are even smaller.

TOM: Maybe they're just into euthanasia.

MIKE: Ah, the blonde leading the blind.

TOM: <Riker> Damn!

>       "Yes, Marrissa," Riker responded.

CROW: <Riker> Sorry, I... uh... have to wash my hair.

>       "Testing yourself for command potential," Riker guessed.
>       "Yes, myself and some others," Marrissa replied.

MIKE: Riker immediately began planning to disguise one of the airlocks as a 
      holodeck.

>       "You can't start with a harder test," Riker said.  "I would be

TOM: <Marrissa> Yes, the Counselor told me about that.

CROW: This is like "Ender's Game", except it's not good at all.

MIKE: A ground round?

MIKE: Gee, I'm sure the Romulans never saw *that* trick before.

TOM: Everybody?
ALL: So Alex shot Riker.

TOM: Let's extinguish what we don't understand.

CROW: She became known as Marrissa the Xenocide.

CROW: Seen it.  Hated it.

>       Marrissa's parents having died in Enterprized, 

MIKE: She was able to put her plan for galactic domination into full swing.

> Captain Picard adopted Marrissa at the end of A Gul's Revenge.

CROW: Hey, I got a message for you right here...
MIKE: Easy, Crow.

> 
> Message from the Author of Away From Home :
>       Some of you were a little confused with my sudden jump to part
> 11 from part 8.  

TOM: Others are confused by my poor writing, characterization, and plot.

> I have recitifyed that problem.  Part 11 is now part 9.
> Part 11 will end up being part 3 of The Away mission and part 10 is part
> 2 of the Away Mission.  

CROW: Okay, so part 11 is now part 10 of the second part of the story...
TOM: No, the tenth part of the second story has been changed to part 9...
MIKE: Wait, I think that's four score and seven parts ago... 
CROW: So who IS playing first base?
TOM: I don't know!
ALL: THIRD BASE!

> What? this is even more confusing.  

MIKE: And Ratliff shows a glimmer of rational thought!

> When then 
> think of Away from Home as a trilogy bound togeter in one volume. 

CROW: ...with duct tape and epoxy resins.  On all four sides!

> I hope this clears this up a little. 

TOM: Since I Oxycuted.

>       For those of you who want to read my other stories (Enterprized,

MIKE: ...I would recommend immediate psychological treatment.

CROW: How did Ratliff get a Web page, and who let him do it??

CROW: Yeah, I gotta admit, that's pretty good artwork...
TOM: Let's get outta here...

[They leave the theater.]

1...2...3...4...5...6...*...

[SOL.  Mike and Tom enter.]

MIKE: So did Crow tell you what he wanted to talk about?
TOM: No, he just said to meet him here.

[Suddenly the lights darken.  In the dim light, you can vaguely see
the outline of Crow.  He is smoking a cigarette.]

CROW: <raspy voice> I'm taking a chance in talking to you here.
TOM: Crow, what are you talking about?
CROW: Don't call me that!  It's too dangerous!  Call me... Deep Shi--
MIKE: Oh, come off it, Crow.

[The lights come back up.  Crow walks over to Mike and Tom.]

CROW: Okay, fine.  But if you get killed, I'll disavow any knowledge
      of your existance.
MIKE: Would you just get on with it?
CROW: <pause> Mike, Tom, I've uncovered something.  A conspiracy more
      insidious than Watergate, the JFK assassination, and yes, even 
      the Van Patten Project.  I am talking about... The Ed Wood-Stephen
      Ratliff Conspiracy!

[Dramatic chord.  A pause.]

TOM: Huh?
CROW: We were lead to believe that Edward D. Wood, Jr., actually died 
      in 1978.
TOM: Right.
CROW: But few people know that his death was actually faked!  See, Ed was 
      caught up in some trouble with the mob, and...
MIKE: Um, Crow...
CROW: Anyway, he went into the FBI Witness Protection program and changed 
      his name to... Stephen Ratliff!  Trying to start a new life, he 
      enrolled in Radford University two years ago and began writing 
      cheezy Star Trek fanfics!
MIKE: Crow, this is nice and everything, but do you have any proof?
CROW: Proof?  PROOF??  I got proof coming out the wazoo!
TOM: Wazoo?
CROW: Exhibit A: Wood and Ratliff are both completely untalented hacks.
MIKE: Well, true, but...
CROW: Exhibit B: Despite this complete lack of talent, they both continue 
      to churn out work at an alarming rate.
TOM: Say, you may be on to something here...
CROW: Exhibit C: They both attack their work with an enthusiasm that seems 
      to belie this lack of discernible talent.
MIKE: Wow, it's all coming together!  What else do you have?
CROW: Exhibit D: Stephen Ratliff enjoys wearing women's clothing!
MIKE: Wait a second, Crow...
CROW: Exhibit E: Ratliff was once married to Dolores Fuller!
TOM: Crow...
CROW: Exhibit F: Ed Wood was an avid Trekkie, even going to the early 
      conventions!

[Mike and Tom both sigh and walk away from Crow, who continues
to babble on about his "exhibits."]

MIKE: You know, it's a real shame when the facts get in the way
      of a good conspiracy.

[Sirens and buzzers go off.]

MIKE: AAAHHHH!!!  WE GOT FANFIC SIGN!
