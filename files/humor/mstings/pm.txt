It would be an exaggeration to say that *every* MiSTer wants to MiST a 
Stephen Ratliff story.  But Ratliff's stories are often discussed in 
ratmm and on the MiSTing dibs-list, and "dibs" on a Ratliff is a highly 
coveted prize.  The eager following generated by his stories is a 
tribute to Stephen's persistence, his good-natured responses to 
criticism, and the unique interpretation of reality presented in his 
oeuvre.  His stories are good enough to maintain interest, yet 
consistently display certain elements which provoke strong, occasionally 
visceral, reactions in so many critics --- all centered around a main 
character who has inspired not one, but two, fanfic parodies portraying 
her as the embodiment of evil.

So when Stephen Ratliff began posting "Premier Ma[r]qui{s}" last 
September, the response on the MiSTing dibs-list was quick and 
overwhelming.  Two dozen novice and experienced MiSTers asked to be part 
of the MiSTing team.  In view of such demand, and in a moment of 
insanity, the "premier dibser" invited any and all aspirants on the 
dibs-list to send in their contributions.  Over a dozen individuals 
actually answered that call.  The technical and editorial problems posed 
by such a large Group-MiSTing were remarkable, but finally overcome.

This is not that MiSTing.

This is a standard-style MiSTing written by:
Loren Haarsma <lhaarsma@opal.tufts.edu>, 
Jarek Myszewski <V335RY46@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>, 
David Conner <dconner@bellatlantic.net>.

The results of the Group-MiSTing will follow in a few weeks....


(If there is any semblance of continuity in MiSTings, then this MiSTing 
 occurs shortly before the MiSTing of Ratliff's "Falling into Command.")

[SOL control room.]
 
[Mike, Tom, Crow, and Gypsy are arranged around the desk in the usual
 way.  On top of the desk is some sort of Milton-Bradley-type board 
 game.  Mike is spinning a wheel which resembles the one in 
 "The Game of LIFE" (tm).]
 
CROW: [chanting as the wheel spins] ... Not Guilty ...
TOM:  [similar]  ... Guilty ...
CROW: ... Not Guilty ...
TOM:  ... Guilty ...
CROW: ... Not Guilty ....
 
[The wheel stops spinning.]
 
CROW: Awwwwww!
TOM:  Ha ha!  Yes!  A hung jury!  "Lose one turn while waiting for
      retrial."
CROW: Rats!
 
[Mike looks up and sees Cambot is on.]
 
MIKE: Oh, hi everybody!  We're just getting some playtesting done on 
      Tom's new boardgame before the Mads ruin our day.  The game's 
      based on the American legal system, and it's called...
 
ALL:  "Criminal Justice!"
 
TOM:  [legal disclaimer voice]  Any resemblance between this game and
      Kentucky Fried Movie's "Scot-Free" is purely coincidental.
 
MIKE: Okay, it's your turn, Gypsy!  The district court just turned 
      down your challenge to the jury selection procedure in your
      original trial.  What do you want to do?
 
GYPSY: Ummm ... I'll appeal!

MIKE: OK, who do you want to argue your case?

GYPSY: Richard Basehart!

MIKE: D'oh!  [slaps his forehead]

CROW: Should've seen that one coming a mile away....

MIKE: No, I mean, do you want to hire a law firm which costs one 
      thousand dollars, ten thousand dollars, or a hundred thousand 
      dollars?

GYPSY: Ten thousand dollars.
 
[Gypsy opens her mouth wide to reveal play-money clipped inside.
 Mike reaches in and takes a bill.]
 
MIKE: OK.  That means I roll the *equal*-odds silver-colored appeals
      dice, and the lower court's decision is... [rolls dice]  Overturned!
 
GYPSY: Yaaaay!
 
MAGIC VOICE:  Commercial sign in ten seconds.

MIKE: Your turn, Tom.  Things are looking grim.  All your pre-trial 
      motions have been denied.  Are you ready for a spin on the verdict 
      wheel?
 
TOM:  Nuh uh.  I'm gonna activate my "media blitz" token *and* play my
      "race" card.
 
MIKE: Ooooooh!  Well, I still have to draw from the post-trial pile.

MAGIC VOICE:  Commercial sign in four ... three ... two....

MIKE: [draws card]  And it says ... "Civil suit!"
 
TOM:  NOOOOOOOOOO!
 
MAGIC VOICE:  Commercial sign now.

[Commercials]


[Return from commercials]

[Mike and bots are cleaning up after the game.]

GYPSY: Wow, Tom, you know a lot about the legal system!

MIKE: ... or at least the way the media reports it.

CROW: Yeah, Servo, since when are you such a legal expert?  It's not 
      like you're a lawyer or anything.

TOM:  Au contraire, mon ami!  Here's my diploma.

MIKE: [reading]  "The Sally Struthers Correspondence School of
      Refrigerator Repair and Law"?

TOM:  Hey, it's an accredited legal institution in Antigua, the Cayman 
      Islands, *and* Belize!

[Mads light starts flashing]
 
MIKE: Uh oh... Perry and Della are calling.
 
[Mike taps Mads button.]
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Hello, inmates!  And may I say that it does my heart proud to 
      see you playfully dabbling with forces of evil far beyond your 
      comprehension!  Speaking of which, did you get those crates I 
      sent you this morning?  Hmmm?
 
[SOL]
 
MIKE: Sure did, Dr. F!  We locked them all in the cargo bay, just like 
      you said.
 
CROW: What was in them, anyway?  They felt like they weighed a ton!
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Never you mind what's in them, serfs!  You'll find out soon 
      enough.  [evil chuckle]  In the meantime, let's take this legal 
      evil and run with it, shall we?  What would you say if I told 
      you that today's experiment makes the subject of your boardgame, 
      by comparison, look like it embodies the wisdom of Solomon and the 
      truth-seeking of Diogenes?
 
[SOL]
 
MIKE: Ummm... I'd say: what is it, some kind of "L.A. Law" fanfic?
 
CROW: Ha!  We could survive one of those without even using *half* 
      the rec.humor lawyer jokes archive!
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: [giggling wickedly]  Ah, my little ragamuffins, I see you have 
      *no* inkling of the horror that I'm about to inflict on you!  Let 
      me put it to you this way: you might think that the author of 
      today's experiment has created some creepy portrayals of life,
      death, love, friendship, responsibility, shock, grief, parenthood, 
      politics, diplomacy, military command structures, and children's 
      rights, but just wait until you get a load of his... *unique* 
      ideas about criminal justice!
 
[SOL]
 
[Mike looks very worried, and the bots are visibly shaking.]
 
MIKE: Is he saying what I think he's saying?  
 
CROW: Mike, I'm scared.  I only know *one* person who fits *that*
      description!
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Well, I see it's finally starting to sink in!  Not so confident 
      now, eh bumpkins?
 
[Pearl Forrester walks into view beside Clayton.  She is dressed as a 
 1950's-tv-style housewife, holding a white feather duster.]

Ma F: [interrupting]  Clayton, I think it's so cute the way you toy 
      with them before you crush their spirits.
 
Dr.F: [taken aback by the unexpected compliment]  Why *thank* you, 
      Mother!  It's so nice of you to notice!  [becomes suspicious]
      What's going on here?!  Why are you cleaning my control panels
      with ... a feather duster?

Ma F: It's relaxing.  I love to watch as the pristine, white feathers 
      become irreparably frayed and stained as they encounter the dust 
      and grime of their surroundings....

Dr.F: Oh.  [pause]  Can I try?

Ma F: [pinches Clayton's cheek]  Wait your turn, Clayton!

Dr.F: Mother, please!  Not in front of the test subjects!  [leers into
      monitor]  And as for you, boobies, eat hot You-Know-Who!  It's 
      your day in court, and here come the judge!  Get ready to do some 
      hard time, habeas corpses!  [stabs his finger triumphantly on the 
      button]

TOM:  I can't believe it.  Ratliff managed to take one of the most
      eloquent political sentences of all time and, um...
MIKE: ... turn it into typical Ratliff prose?
TOM:  Yeah.

>>                                          To secure these rights,

>> Chapter One
>> 
>>         Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard entered the bridge
 
BOTS: BOOOOOOOO!!!  *Hissssss*!!
MIKE: Guys, it's *way* too early in the fanfic for that.
 
>>                                                                 of the
>> USS Miranda.  
 
TOM:  The first thing she noticed were the fruit-topped hats that 
      everyone wore.
 
>>               Noticing Captain T'Gwen Washington she said, "Reporting as
>> ordered, Captain."
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  How soon till you're incapacitated in some improbable 
      fashion so I can take command?
MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  Patience, Marrissa, the author will soon make all the
      necessary arrangements.
 
>>         "Lieutenant Commander Picard, I presume," T'Gwen said.  "I
>> regret that I can not take command of the Stargazer at the moment, but I
>> must wait for the Victory to arrive so I can turn over command of the
>> Miranda to Captain Zimbata."
>>         "I understand, Captain, I assume that means 
 
MIKE: [as Daffy Duck]  It's mine!  Mine!  Mine!  Mine!  I'm rich!  I'm 
      wealthy!  Yahoo!
 
>>                                                     I will be turning
>> command over to our Cardassian First Officer," Marrissa commented.

TOM:  Does this sound like Marrissa to you?

>>         "No, Gusat has orders to report to Captain Washington of the
>> Stargazer, and since I have not taken command of that vessel yet, he can
>> not report in, and hence command it," Washington commented.  "So I guess
>> you will have to stay in command until then."
 
ALL:  [general groans of agony]
MIKE: Well, we only had to wait for the fourth line of dialog for the
      inevitable.  That didn't take too long, guys.
TOM:  Tonight on Plot Contrivance Theater... Marrissa is deftly 
      maneuvered into commanding a starship she has no business 
      commanding yet again!
 
>>         "It's no hardship," Marrissa replied.  
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  It's like they say, power corrupts, and absolute 
      power is fun, fun, fun!
TOM:  [singing] ...'til her daddy takes the starship awayyyyyy....
 
>>                                                 "Oh, and Captain, the
>> Cardassian Central Command has requested permission for their officers

>> uniforms.  
 
MIKE: They're *much* more stylish!
 
>>            The Admiralty has informed them that such decisions are the
>> Captain's prerogative on an individual basis."
>>         "Inform the Cardassian Central Command that I will grant that
>> permission," the half Vulcan Captain replied.  "I suggest that you grant
>> interim permission as well, Commander."
 
TOM:  It's blazing all-out bureaucratic action on board the USS Miranda!
 
>>         "Aye, sir,"  Picard replied.  "If you'll excuse me, I've just
>> been informed that I'm to attend a diplomatic function tonight aboard
>> the station, and I forgot to pack a dress."
 
TOM:  Jean-Luc wears dresses to diplomatic functions?!  [**shudder**]
MIKE: No, Tom ... that's *Marrissa* Picard.
CROW: I suppose she forgot to pack her Starfleet dress uniform too?
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  So I'll just go naked.  I do like to give the 
      peasants a little thrill every now and then.
 
>>         "Dismissed, Lieutenant Commander," Captain T'Gwen Washington
>> concluded.
>> 
>>         Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard walked down Deep Space
>> Nine's Promenade, 
 
CROW: ... or promenaded down DS9's Walk.
 
>>                   while waiting for Garak to finish her dress.

TOM:  [as Marrissa]  Oh, this brings back memories!  Right about here 
      was where Riker landed after I pushed him off the walkway....
MIKE: And she's been pushing around Starfleet officers ever since.

>>                                                                 As she
>> walked toward Quark's she spied Captain Sisko's son, Jake.  "Jake," she
>> called out.  As he walked up to Marrissa, she continued, "Remember me,
>> Marrissa?"
 
CROW: [as Jake]  My name is Jake.  I thought *you* were Marrissa.
TOM:  Tragically, Marrissa's years of megalomaniacal power lust had
      finally taken their toll, as she began having ongoing 
      conversations with herself....

>>         "How could I forget the person who provided me with my first,
>> and so far only authorized biography contract," Jake replied.
>> "Especially since it sold five trillion copies, and was on the
>> bestsellers list for 8 weeks.
 
CROW: [coughs]  Five *trillion*?!?!?!  Come on, could we please have just
      *some* sense of proportion here?
MIKE: Well, I don't know, maybe that's accurate.  In Marrissa's universe,
      Federation law probably requires that all citizens own a copy of 
      Marrissa's biography under penalty of death, like Mao's Little 
      Red Book.
TOM:  Yeah, I think that was one of the lesser-known codicils to that 
      Starfleet regulation mandating a Kids Crew for every starship....
 
>>                                Tell me, can I write a sequel?"
 
CROW: [as Jake]  I want to inflict more evil upon the galaxy!
 
>>         "Maybe when I've done a little more," Marrissa said.

TOM:  [as Marrissa]  We should let the little people bask in my 
      glory before I dominate the entire galaxy, but let's at least wait 
      until I become Grand Admiral of Starfleet and Queen of Essex 
      before we start on the second book.  Say, two weeks from now?

>>                                                               "Your last
>> one ended when I took that Trakce ship.  I've only discovered that I'm a
>> Princess and got promoted since then."
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  Oh, and I've slaughtered a few thousand Romulans.  
      Nothing important.
 
>>         "I didn't see the Enterprise come in, and it's hard to miss a
>> Galaxy class starship," Jake commented.  
 
TOM:  I don't mean to say the Enterprise is big, but when it orbits around
      a planet, it orbits *around* a planet....
CROW: [rim-shot sound]
TOM:  Thank you.  You've been a great audience.  Enjoy the buffet.
 
>>                                          "So are you here on vacation?"

CROW: Now there's an old line....

>>         "No, I got a promotion and a transfer," Marrissa replied.  "I'm
>> now Second Officer and Fighter Commander on the USS Stargazer NCC-2893."
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Only 20 lines into chapter one, and I've already 
      recited all my accomplishments and titles.  I'm ahead of schedule!
 
>>         "Congratulations, Marrissa," Jake replied.  
 
MIKE: Whoa!  Ratliff actually spelled "congratulations" correctly!  
      This may be a first!
TOM:  Kinda sad, really --- like taking away one of the constants of the
      universe.  Death, taxes, and "congraduations."
 
>>                                                    "If I remember what
>> my dad said, you'll be having a great adventure in the demilitarized
>> zone."
 
CROW: [as Jake]  My dad often tells me classified stuff like that.
MIKE: Great adventure, right.  That's what the soldiers in Vietnam said 
      about *their* Demilitarized Zone.
 
>>         "The Marqui thought they had problems with the Intrepid class,"
>> Marrissa said.  "Wait till they see what my Essex-10 fighters can do."
 
MIKE: [as Jack Nicholson]  Wait'll they get a load of *me*.
 
>>         "Record a battle for me," Jake asked.  "It might help with my
>> series I'm writing about a Marqui fighter."
>>         "You know a Marqui?" Marrissa inquired
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  I know a Countess!  And I'm a Princess!  Did I
      mention that I'm a Princess?
 
>>         "Not really, but I've interviewed several captured ones and I've
>> been writing fiction books about one," Jake said.  "Hey, isn't that your
>> new first officer, Gusat?"
 
MIKE: [as Jake]  Isn't that the guy who's *supposed* to be commanding your
      ship now?
 
>>         "I believe you are right, Jake," Marrissa replied.  "If you will
>> excuse me, I better go introduce myself."
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  And recite *all* my titles and accomplishments again.
 
>> 
>>         The Cardassian officer Gusat was on his way to Quarks for a
>> little Dabo 
 
TOM:  I guess a little Dabo will do ya....
 
>> when Marrissa caught up with him.  "Gusat," she inquired.
>>         "Yes," he responded.
>>         "I'm Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard, 
 
ALL:  [reciting in unison, dully]  ... Second Officer of the USS Stargazer, 
      Fighter Commander of the USS Stargazer, Lord High Admiral of Star 
      Fleet Kids Crews, Princess and heir to the throne of Essex, and the 
      greatest teenager in the history of humanity....
 
>>                                                     I'll be serving as
>> Second Officer and Fighter Commander under you on the Stargazer."
>>         "I've been looking forward to meeting you face to face," Gusat
>> smiled.
 
CROW: [as Gusat, snickering]  I just had to find out if the rumors 
      were true --- a fourteen-year old girl?!  What are your
      Starfleet people smoking?!?

>>         "Have we meet before?" Marrissa asked.

TOM:  ... or *MET* before?

>>         "We have," Gusat responded.  "I was a helmsman on Gul Ducat's
>> ship when you drove him insane."
 
MIKE: Oh, I know how he feels.
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  I do have that effect on people....
 
>>         "I wasn't aware that I caused him that much harm," Marrissa
>> replied. "I only wanted to 
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Kill him, mutilate his body and scatter his 
      entrails from here to Antares!  Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!! 
      Faster, Pussycat!  Kill!  Kill!  Oh, I'm sorry, you were saying?

>>                            humiliate him."
>>         "Well you did a good job and since he went mad, everyone under
>> him got promoted," Gusat said.  "So I must thank you for that."
 
TOM:  [Russian accent]  You see, Keptin, you start talking vith 
      imaginary bunny rabbits, and ve *all* move up in rank!

>>         "Your welcome, Glinn," Marrissa replied

MIKE: [as Gusat]  No, *your* welcome.  *My* thanks....  
      Argh!  Now you bots have got *me* doing grammar flames, too.
BOTS: [snicker]

>>                                                 as they sat down at the
>> bar.  "Strawberry soda, Quark, and don't you even think of spiking it
>> this time."
>>         "Spiking it?" Glinn Gusat questioned.
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  It's an old Earth sports term.  It means 
      he slammed it to the floor as hard as he could.
 
>>         "He, unintentionally he claims, gave me a strawberry Bajoran ale
>> when I was here for my twelfth birthday," Marrissa explained.  "And I

CROW: Now *there's* an image I could've lived without.
MIKE: [as Marrissa] ... 'Coursh, now that I'm older, I'se able to have 
      all the little drinkies I want, and there'sh [hic!] no effect
      on me at all!  Say, d'you know you'se kinda cute wish shose 
      little ridge-y thingies on your head?

CROW: [Elvis voice]  Thankyouverymuuuuch.

>>                                            had ordered the bridge crew to

CROW: Punish the doctor for the admiral's decision ... yeah, that makes

MIKE: Jeez, is there *anybody* in Ratliff's universe who isn't an 
      obsessive workaholic?
 
>>                                                               Of the 132

TOM:  [in a sing-songy falsetto]  Do do DO do do.  Here I am, surrounded 
      by enemy rebels who are totally familiar with Starfleet equipment 
      and procedures.  I think I'll beam my whole crew down to a planet 
      for shore leave.  Do do DO do do.  Nothing could possibly go 
      wrong.  Do do DO do do.

>>         "Doctor, a Marqui raider has entered the system," an ensign said
>> from the helm.
>>         "Hail them," Doctor Pazzi stated.
 
TOM:  [as ensign]  Hailstorm initiated, sir!
 
>>         The ex-Star Fleet Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington

>>         "The only ones here are us chickens," Pazzi responded.
 
TOM:  Kinda ironic, isn't it, to have the whole crew on the USS Fearless
      be a bunch of chickens?
CROW: Does that make them the Chickens of Tomorrow?
 
>>         "Very good, one to beam directly to the bridge," Eddington
>> ordered.
>>         The channel closed, and Eddington materialized on the bridge.
 
MIKE: [as Eddington]  No, you idiots!  Not London Bridge!!!
 
>> Doctor Pazzi got up out of the center seat and said, 
 
TOM:  [as Pazzi]  I see they got you into the crappy fanfics too, eh?
 
>>                                                      "Computer, transfer

CROW: Wow!  Promotions sure come fast when you know the ship's doctor!
MIKE: Ah, I see Ratliff's piracy scenes are every bit as thrilling as 
      his battle scenes.

      Oh no!  We've looped back to "Time Speeder"!

[SOL control room]
 
[Crow and Tom are wearing three-pointed colonial hats, colonial vests 
 and powdered wigs.  Tom is scribbling on a parchment with a quill pen
 behind a tilted desk.  Mike enters the room.]
 
MIKE: Hi guys.  What are you doing?
 
TOM:  Oh, we're just declaring independence from Deep 13.
 
MIKE: Oh, I see.  Well, don't let me keep you from... Huh?!?  Let me see
      that.

[Mike leans down to look at the parchment.]
 
TOM:  See, Mike, we were inspired by Stephen B. Ratliff's stirring
      political testimonial about the necessity of asserting your
      inalienable rights as sentient beings in the face of tyranny and
      oppression.
 
CROW: Yeah, and we realized that up here on the Satellite of Love, 
      *we've* got a lot to complain about because of a tyrannical 
      oppressor, too!  So we thought: why should we let Thomas Jefferson 
      and Stephen Ratliff have all the fun?  *We* want a piece of this 
      action, too!
 
MIKE: Okay ... so what have you Founding Fathers written so far?
 
TOM:  Well, we just finished it.  Let me read it to you and see what you
      think.  *Ahem*
 
      "When in the course of human and robotic events it becomes
      necessary to run to a window and shout, 'I'm mad as hell, and I'm
      not gonna take this anymore!' it's usually a pretty good idea to
      have a few reasons for doing that in mind so that you can explain
      yourself to anyone on the street who looks at you funny, and
      especially to the judge that you get hauled in front of for
      disturbing the peace.
 
      It seems obvious to us that people and bots should be free to have
      pretty much whatever harmless fun they want to and not have to
      worry about The Man coming down on them like a ton of bricks.  And
      if some tyrannical oppressor ain't down wid dat, then it's time to
      rise to the call of Michael Jackson's famous battle cry, and 'Make
      that change!'
 
      We know, we know, you probably think we're just a bunch of whiners
      with nothing better to do than change our system of government,
      but believe you us, we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't have
      *tons* of good reasons!  So now, we must declare that we have
      officially Had It Up To Here, and will now become an independent
      entity from Deep 13.

      The history of the present Mad Scientist of Deep 13 is a history of 
      repeated injuries and usurpations and really bad hair days, all 
      having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over 
      this Satellite.  To prove this, let these facts be submitted to a 
      candid, shocked, and appalled world:
 
      He has confined us to a satellite orbiting high above the Earth.
 
      He has, wilfully and with intent to destroy our sanity, forced
      us to watch movies of such a foul nature that no one can escape
      from their clutches unscathed.
 
      He has called us together to watch said movies at a place unusual,
      uncomfortable, and distant from the video rental depositories, 
      for the sole purpose of fatiguing us into compliance with his 
      measures.

      He has left us to the mercy of any weird but dangerous aliens 
      or colossal men who happen to wander by.

      He has quartered large blond humans on the satellite without our 
      consent.

      He has denied us our inalienable right to keep and bear
      thermonuclear weapons --- even the little bitty ones.

      He has failed to provide clearly marked emergency exits in case
      of fire.

      He has denied us refills for the vending machines in the
      cafeteria, forcing us to eat stale Mars bars for snacks.

      He has baked cookies and failed to offer us any.

      He has denied us access to 1-900 phone numbers.

      He has prevented us from developing Meaningful Relationships 
      with Kim Cattrall, the Creepy Girl, and other personages who have
      from time to time struck our fancy.

      We have asked him repeatedly to Lay Off, only to be met with
      maniacal laughter.  Mad Scientists who act as such are unfit
      to control their own lives, let alone anyone else's.

      And it's not like this is something new we're springing on him 
      all of a sudden.  We've Told It Like It Is countless times, and 
      even tried to get his sidekick to cut us some slack once in a 
      while.  Nada.  We therefore declare, to anyone who cares, that we,
      the residents of the Satellite of Love, are Free and Independent 
      from Deep 13, free to cut whatever deals we want with whomever we
      want.  To this goal we pledge our RAM chips, our graphic novel 
      collections, and whatever free time we can shake loose."


TOM:  Well, whaddya think?
 
MIKE: I like it!  Good job, guys!  So when do we send this to 
      Dr. Forrester?
 
CROW: Oh, we already did!
 
TOM:  Yeah, this here is the copy that we're going to preserve in an
      airtight cube and put on display in the Satellite Historical
      Archives.  We already sent another copy down the Umbilicus to the
      Mads.
 
MIKE: You know, for a couple of robots who claim that they can't clean 
      their rooms because their arms don't work, you guys sure work fast 
      when you want to.
 
TOM:  But Mike, that's completely different, don't you see, because....
 
[The Mads light starts flashing.]
 
TOM:  Whoops, it's Dr. F!  He must have read our Declaration.
 
[Mike hits the Mads button.]
 
[Deep 13]
 
[In the background, Pearl Forrester, dressed in combat fatigues and 
 carrying various weapons, walks past the monitor.  Clayton ignores 
 this.  Dr. Forrester is holding his copy of the SOL's Declaration of 
 Independence in one hand and wiping tears out of his eyes with his 
 other hand.  He seems very moved.]
 
Dr.F: Hello, revolutionaries!  [sniff, sniff]  Well, I guess I
      should have known this moment would come.  These test subjects
      today just grow up so fast, don't they?  [sniff]  Anyway, I
      just read your little plea for freedom, and what can I say?  I
      guess I've come to see the error of my ways.  Darn it,
      experimentation without representation is just plain wrong!
      So I'm going to fulfill your little hearts' desire and grant
      you the independence you crave.  From now on, the Satellite of
      Love is a distinct and separate entity from Deep 13 Research Labs.

[SOL]

CROW: Hey!  That was easy!

TOM:  Why didn't we think of this before?
 
MIKE: I don't believe it!  You're really going to grant us independence, 
      Dr. F?
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: That's right, Mike!  No longer must you suffer the bonds of
      oppression and injustice!  Freedom is yours, my little
      Minutemen!  But in order to make it official, there's just one
      thing left to do....
 
[Dr. Forrester walks over to a wall and opens a panel.  Inside is a

 On position to Off.]
 
Dr.F: There!  Now you're no longer dependent on Deep 13 for your
      atmosphere!  You're free to find your own source of oxygen!
      Free as the air you breathe!  Of course, that's going to be in
      short supply before long, but what do you care?  You're free
      to chart your own course, to determine your own destiny, to
      live out your lives!  Mike's life might be a little shorter
      than everyone else's up there, but there's always a price to
      pay for freedom, isn't there?  Well, I wish you luck!  Enjoy
      your newfound freedom!  Hope you've got the *constitution* for
      it, Mike!  [Dr. Forrester breaks into maniacal laughter.]
 
[SOL]

[Mike's breathing is labored, and his face is blue.]
 
CROW: Mike's turning blue!  We gotta do something, Servo!
 
TOM:  C'mon Dr. F., this isn't funny anymore!  Mike's suffocating here!
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Sorry, guys, you're independent now!  That means your life
      support is now your problem!  Although ... there might be a
      way....
 
[SOL]
 
CROW & TOM: What?  WHAT?!?
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Well, your little document *does* give you the power to make
      treaties.  And if we were to draw up an agreement in which
      *you* continue to watch what I send you in exchange for *me*
      sending you life support, I'm *sure* we can arrange to....
 
[SOL]

[Mike collapses behind the control panel.]
 
CROW & TOM: We agree!  WE AGREE!!!
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Fine!  I'll have my secretaries get right on it, and have the
      treaty sent up the Umbilicus for you to sign as soon as it's
      done.  And as a gesture of good faith....  [Dr. F. switches the
      SOL life support back on.]  Now hurry on back to the theater,
      you little wild rebels!  There's lots more Ratliff left to
      watch!
 
[SOL]
 
TOM:  [sigh]  Right back where we started.
 
CROW: Yeah, but at least we're watching bad movies and usenet posts
      as a free and independent nation now!
 
TOM:  [frustrated]  Crow....
 
[Lights flash, buzzers buzz, pandemonium erupts.]
 
TOM:  Aaaah!  Fanfic sign!  Quick, Crow, drag Mike along, we gotta go....

      he has to make another one right away to balance it out!
MIKE: Does this mean Ratliff's gonna introduce us to the leader of the

MIKE: Either bite your tongue, or I'll rip out your voice box.

MIKE: Ratliff is sending armed ships into a "demilitarized zone" to

CROW: So ... they'll be playing "Hi'den Seek!"
 
>>         Joining me on this mission will be my Cardassian first officer,
>> Gusat, and several other members of the Cardassia Central Command. 
 
MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  The Maquis believe that Starfleet is cooperating with 
      the Cardassian government to destroy the Maquis.  To convince them 
      otherwise, we're inviting a Cardassian crew onto our Star Fleet ship.

TOM:  Do you get the idea that Ratliff saw "Logan's Run" once, and 
      decided that they really had the right idea for how to run a 
      society?

>>         Most of our personnel have arrived.  However, I am distressed by

MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  I'm gonna get sloshed with them down at the bar and

      The Little Princess....

CROW: ... or readied in her Lounge Room....
TOM:  Oh, great, strap yourselves in for yet another "All Sing the 
      Praises of Commander Marrissa Amber Flores Picard" scene!
 
>>         "If she does as well with fighters against Marqui; as she does

>>         "Practical jokes during a drill," Gusat responded.  "I'd like to

TOM:  I'd like to know why she hasn't been court-martialed and flogged 
      for it!
MIKE: Annoying fellow crew members with childish pranks is easy ... once 
      you know the secret!

CROW: [heavy sigh of despair]  The "comic relief" scene, ladies and

TOM:  Isn't that kind of small for a fighter bay?  That's, like, one 
      third the size of a football field!
MIKE: Oh, it's not the real fighter bay, it's just the Fisher-Price 
      Kids Crew fighter bay.

CROW: [as Marrissa]  And a princess!  Did I mention that I'm a princess

TOM:  [as officers]  Oh, sure, just go ahead and drone on about things 
      which are absolutely irrelevant to doing our jobs, but will inflate 
      your ego even more than it already is.  We'll all sit here and 
      pretend to be enthralled since you control who lives and who dies....

>>         "Go ahead, I'd like to know what else you have to do," Gusat

MIKE: [as Gusat]  ... so they'll know what to put on your obituary after
      you die at my hand.

>>         "Coordinating Officer of the Kid's Crew program, Heir to the
>> throne of Essex," Marrissa finished.
 
CROW: "Finished?"  Ha!  She's only *begun* to collect power and titles!
TOM:  [as commercial announcer]  The introduction sequence!  It serves a
      much needed purpose in today's fanfic, much like Roger Corman's 
      walking scenes, the rock-climbing in "Lost Continent," and almost 
      all of the movie "Sidehackers"!  So the next time *you* need to pad 
      out a story, be sure to consider the padding method preferred by 
      Stephen Ratliff!  Introduction sequences!  Ask for them by name!

>> Szustakowski.  She will be joining us in the zone," Captain Washington
>> concluded.
>>         "Bridge to Captain Washington," Katherine Lockard interrupted.
>>         "Go ahead Lieutenant," Washington replied.
>>         "A priority one signal has come in from Captain George Siena of
>> the Fearless,"  Lieutenant Katherine Lockard announced.  
 
TOM:  Along with Commander Bart Tungsten and Lieutenant Cliff Beefpile,
      Captain George "Burnt" Siena kicked butt across the galaxy!

>>                                                          "Request for
>> immediate assistance.

CROW: Ironically, the Fearless is in a panic!

>>                        Captain Sisko has asked if we can handle it, since
>> Commander Worf has the Defiant in the Gamma Quadrant."
>>         "Inform Sisko that we will be underway as soon as he gives us
>> clearance," Captain Washington replied, standing up.
 
CROW: Umm, maybe I'm missing something here, but doesn't "immediate 
      assistance" imply that they've got clearance or whatever?
MIKE: In the Ratliverse, all requests for emergency assistance have
      to be filed in triplicate and cleared with both Starfleet Command
      and Kids Crew Headquarters before anybody's allowed to help.
 
>> 
>>         From the stairs to the deck below, the Command crew of the USS
>> Stargazer emerged onto the bridge.  
 
MIKE: No one will be seated during the gripping stair-climbing scene.
 
>>                                     Lieutenant Katherine Lockard
>> relinquished the Command chair to Captain T'Gwen Washington as the rest
>> of the Command crew filed in.  She took over the helm from some junior
>> officer.  
 
TOM:  [as announcer]  Ensign Throwaway is back!  And this time, 
      it's personal!
MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  Wait!  Hold everything!  There's a junior officer here
      whose name we don't know!  We're not going *anywhere* until we start 
      another round of introductions!!!
 
>>           Glinn Gusat took his seat beside the Captain.  Duvek relieved
>> his second, Lieutenant Lavelle and Lieutenant Lockard and Assist Gavek
>> both took up tactical as Lockard was helping Gavek learn the system.
 
CROW: Oh, this is encouraging.  Let's go into a crisis situation with 
      half of our crew learning on the job!
TOM:  At least they don't have to wait until next Tuesday for most of
      their equipment....
 
>> Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard 
 
ALL:  [reciting in unison, dully]  ... Second Officer of the USS Stargazer, 
      Fighter Commander of the USS Stargazer, Lord High Admiral of Star 
      Fleet Kids Crews, Princess and heir to the throne of Essex, and the 
      greatest teenager in the history of humanity...
 
>>                                       sat down at the Fighter Commander
>> console.
>>         "Ops, do we have clearance?" Captain Washington asked.
 
TOM:  [as Ops]  Yes, up to 50 percent off all items in the store.
 
>>         "Clearance from Deep Space Nine has been logged," Duvek replied.

MIKE: "Got your clearance, Clarence?"
CROW: "What's your vector, Victor?"
TOM:  "Roger, Roger."
MIKE: The "Airplane" sketch, ladies and gentlemen, the "Airplane" sketch.

>>         "CONN?"
 
TOM:  COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!
MIKE: Oh, come on, Tom, we've done that joke about 58 times by now!
TOM:  Yeah, I know, but it's not a joke, it's primal scream therapy
      to stave off the despair and horror of knowing that this Ratliff
      fanfic has barely even *started* yet.  

>>         "Departure course laid in and awaiting your command," Katherine
>> Lockard replied.

CROW: Maybe we should just give up and scream through the entire fanfic.

>>         "Release Docking clamps, forward and aft thrusters to station
>> keeping.  Port thrusters to one quarter," T'Gwen Washington ordered.
>> "Take us out, Lieutenant."
 
TOM:  Always obedient, the Lieutenant drew her phaser and took out the 
      entire bridge crew.  Marrissa was instantly, irrevocably and
      permanently disintegrated.  Then she pointed the weapon at her own 
      head and fired.  The End.
MIKE: I can see that scream didn't last very long....
 
>> 
>>         Stargazer pulled away from lower pylon two of Deep Space Nine.
>> Sliding sideways she 
 
CROW: She slides sideways by the seashore!
 
>>                      cleared the port and then pulled out of Deep Space
>> Nine away from the wormhole.
 
MIKE: The raucous "No More Marrissa" party at Quark's could almost be 
      heard through the vacuum of space.
 
>> 
>>         "Now clear of Deep Space Nine," Kathy announced.
>>         "Captain Sisko sends his best wishes," Assist Glinn Duvek
>> informed.
 
TOM:  [as Duvek]  Oh, he also said: "Don't come back if *she's* on board."
 
>>         "Thank him for me.  CONN course, one five two, mark six two,"
>> Captain Washington ordered.  "Warp eight, it's time we see what this
>> ship can do.  Commander Picard, have two wings ready to take off on a
>> moment's notice."
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Yes, Captain, but it'll take time for me to grow 
      them, and it's really going to hurt to remove them!
 
>>         "Blue and Black wings will be ready in five minutes," Marrissa
>> replied.  "Please note that in the future I intend to cut that time to
>> two minutes."
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  Beatings will continue until the pilots bend 
      to my will.
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  I've been studying up on 20th Century KGB torture
      and blackmail techniques to keep my people in line!
 
>>         "So noted," Captain Washington said.
 
CROW: [as T'Gwen]  And please note that in the future I intend to cut 
      your throat at the first opportunity....

TOM:  I'm sure she'll get with the program before too long.
 
>> 
>>         "Someone has stolen Captain Seina's ship," Washington stated
>> before her assembled bridge crew.
 
MIKE: Stargazer bridge crew comes with everything you see here.  Some
      assembly required.  Batteries not included.
 
>>         "Excuse me Captain, did you say stole?" Lieutenant Ross Lockard
>> asked, shocked.  "You don't steal a starship ... we haven't had one

TOM:  Hey, didn't somebody steal a starship in "Time Speeder?"
CROW: Yeah, but this story takes place somewhere before "Time Speeder."
      Isn't Marrissa a full Captain in "Time Speeder?"
TOM:  No, "Time Speeder" actually occurs shortly before this story in 
      Ratliff's timeline.  She's in command, of course, but she's not
      a captain.
CROW: I guess even Ratliff wants to forget about that story!
 
>>         "Captain Seina believes the Maquis commandeered his vessel,"
>> Washington replied.

MIKE: I don't know what frightens me more --- that Ratliff created this 
      insanely detailed timeline for his stories and promptly ignores it,
      or that we've got the damn thing memorized now....

>>                     "He also suspects his Doctor, who he left in

>>         "Makes sense," Glinn Gusat responded.  
 
TOM:  [as Gusat] ... except for the parts about leaving a Doctor in 
      command, and giving almost your whole crew shore leave while in 
      hostile territory....

CROW: [as T'Gwen]  We have orders to put a gag on Marrissa!
ALL:  [cheering and applause]
MIKE: So, has anybody else spotted the subtle clues that Admiral Ellis 
      might secretly be one of the bad guys?
TOM:  Have *you* guessed the identity of the secret villain?  If so, 
      turn to page 125 and see how Encyclopedia Marrissa solved 
      "The Case of the Evil Admiral Ellis!"
 
>>                                                                     We

>>         "Makes sense," Glinn Gusat commented.
 
TOM:  [as T'Gwen]  It's also been rumored that the Fairy Godmothers of
      Xanadu gave the Maquis a magic powder that let them transform the 
      Fearless into a polka-dotted rhinoceros so that they could pass 
      through Federation territory without being noticed!
CROW: [as Gusat]  Makes sense.
MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  We've also determined that the Borg invasion was
      *really* triggered by the Masons and Communists of old Earth under 
      the leadership of Adolf Hitler in order to provide a cover for their 
      plan to gain a controlling interest in the dilithium mining industry!
CROW: [as Gusat]  Makes sense.

>> 
>>         Kerstin Szustakowski had just reached Admiral Ellis.  Apparently

TOM:  Finally, an admiral with some brains.
CROW: Have we *ever* seen one of those in Star Trek?
TOM:  Hmm....  Well, Kirk, I guess, but I think that's the reason 
      they had to demote him....

>>           "What is it? I've got Personnel Review Forms to finish," the
>> Admiral snapped.
 
CROW: 9-1-1 emergency, please hold....
TOM:  [as Ellis]  How am I supposed to get this paperwork done when you
      people keep interrupting me with your Priority 1 distress calls?!!
 
>>         "I need immediate assistance," Kerstin stated.  "I've got forty

MIKE: [as Kerstin]  And to top it all off, the replicators won't give me

>>         "And you are?" Ellis said with contempt.
>>         "Kerstin Szustakowski, Captain, Kid's Crew USS Roanoke," she
>> replied.  "When can I expect assistance?"

CROW: [as Ellis]  You kids should be able to handle this by yourselves! 
      Haven't you ever seen "Home Alone"?!

>>         "What assistance," Ellis sneered.  "You aren't worth the
>> trouble.  Ellis out."
 
TOM:  Ah, I love the subtle, devious manipulations of a Ratliff villain!
MIKE: He could have at least *pretended* to send out assistance, but I
      guess that would have been just too subtle.
CROW: Well, at least he's not named "Yrev Tpurroc" this time....

>> 
>>         Kerstin wasn't happy with the latest development.  She'd done
>> just like the manual said.  
 
MIKE: Guess it's time to call the toll-free tech support line.
CROW: [as Kerstin]  I don't understand!  I don't *have* an "any" key!

>>                             But the Bastard wouldn't help her as the
>> regulations required.
 
MIKE: Hey, watch your language, little girl!
TOM:  I tell you, this Kids Crew program is a breeding ground for 
      juvenile delinquency, Communism, and beatnikkery!
 
>>                       Fortunately, Kerstin followed the advice of her

CROW: Kill 'em all, and let God sort 'em out?

MIKE: [as Dennis Hopper]  Do you know what would happen if Marrissa heard

>>         "No offense intended, Lieutenant," the Captain apologized.
>>         "None taken, Captain," Kathy replied.  
 
TOM:  [as Lockard]  But I am taking notes.  Once we rule Starfleet, say

MIKE: [as Marrissa]  My fighter is missing one.
 
>> "Kerstin suggested that you'd be ready to decode her messages."
>>         "I'll be ready," Kathy replied.
>>         Marrissa nodded and tapped her communicator.  "Attention all
>> Fighter Wings, 
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  There's a blue-light special on all poopie suits in
      Aisle 5!
 
>>                red wing, blue wing, to launch status.  Green wing, black

TOM:  [as Luke Skywalker]  Red Five standing by....
 
>> Closing the channel she continued.  "With your permission Captain, I'll

>> 
>>         Ro Laren was not in good sprits.  
 
MIKE: Her mast was shaky and her sails tattered.
CROW: [as Ratliff]  The spellchecker did it!  I knew that "sprit" was 
      a sailing term that had nothing to do with this story, but the 
      spellchecker threatened to kill my dog if I didn't go along with it!
TOM:  [as Ro, depressed]  Should have known I couldn't avoid being in a 
      Ratliff story forever....
 
>>                                            She had lead the Maquis on
>> board the Roanoke, after gassing its crew.  Ro knew of no way she could
>> have been blocked in her takeover of the starship.  
 
CROW: [as Ro]  It *must* be some cheesy plot device....  But what?
 
>>                                                     She knew about the
>> fact that the gas was ineffective on children.  Could it be that the
>> children had command of the ship?  No, she dismissed the thought.  No
>> Captain would allow the children to have command level access.  
 
MIKE: Yes, that's what any *mentally competent* person would think.
TOM:  So Ro was the only person in the entire galaxy not to buy a copy
      of Marrissa's biography?

>>                                                                 And who
>> ever was fighting her off 
 
ALL:  Hi Keeba!
 
>>                           had to have that.  Even with that Kid's Crew
>> regulation they passed just before she left Star Fleet.
>>         The Roanoke had destroyed her ship, and all who remained aboard.
 
TOM:  Ah, the joys of childhood.  First day of school, first crush, 
      first taste of bloodlust and indiscriminate slaughter....
MIKE: And since this all happened off-camera, just take our word for it.
CROW: Actually, we should be thankful for that!  We were spared another 
      excruciating Ratliff battle scene.
 
>> At least that wouldn't happen to any one else.  Ro had ordered phaser
>> power conduits disconnected.  It was now time to call for back up.
>> "Maquis Croatan to Marqui Defiance, help requested," 
 
CROW: My God, he can't even keep it consistent within *the same 
      friggin' sentence*!!!!!
 
>>                                                      Ro said over her
>> portable communications equipment.  "I've been locked out."
 
TOM:  [as Fred Flintstone]  WIIIIIIIL - MAAAAAAAA !!!!!
MIKE: [as Ro]  And I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for 
      those meddling kids!
CROW: [as Defiance]  Listen, we've got a lot of paperwork to do over
      here ... call us back later!

MIKE: In viewing room one on board the Satellite of Love, the torture had 
      been going on for some time....

>>        The temporary command center was experiencing another crisis.
 
MIKE: [as command center temp]  Look, you've *got* to sign my time card!
 
>> "Multiple contacts coming out of warp," the boy taking care of sensors
>> announced.  "A dozen Maquis raiders and one Intrepid class Starship, in
>> formation."
>>         "Tactical, weapons status?" Kerstin asked.

CROW: [as tactical]  Spitballs loaded and ready, sir!

>>         "No power to phasers," a girl replied.  "Torpedo launching
>> systems jammed."
>>         "And no way to run either," Kerstin responded.  
 
TOM:  [singing]  No where to run, baby ... no where to hide.
 
>>                                                         "ETA on the
>> Stargazer."
>>         "Three minutes," a boy replied.
>>         "Three minutes, we can do that," Kerstin smiled.  "Tell me,
>> Ashaya, is the loading system still OK for the torpedoes?"
 
CROW: [as Ashaya]  That's a rather personal question, isn't it?
 
>>         "Yes, Kerstin," the tactical officer responded.  "But what good
>> is that going to do?"
>>         "Transporters are still on line aren't they?" Kerstin asked.  A
>> boy responded with a nod.  "Then we'll transport them. I just love
>> Tactics Monthly."
 
TOM:  [as announcer reading headlines]  "31 New Ways to Maim and Kill!"
CROW: [same] "New covert-action fashions for the 90's!"
MIKE: [same] "Does your enemy still respect you?  Take this qwik quiz."
TOM:  I don't suppose anybody thought of transporting the *Maquis
      invaders* into space?
MIKE: Space?  Why not just transport them into the brig?
TOM:  No, Marrissa trained them too well:  "Always choose the solution 
      that achieves the highest body count, because that's how we keep
      score!"

>> 
>>         Eddington smiled as his fleet approached the drifting Roanoke.
>> It was just waiting for his forces.  
 
MIKE: [as Eddington, smugly]  God, I'm good.
 
>>                                      He wondered why Ro hadn't been able
>> to take over the ship.  
 
CROW: [as Wicked Witch of the West]  These things must be done 
      deeeeeelicately.
 
>>                         She was one of the Maquis' most experienced
>> operatives, that's why she had been assigned the task of taking the
>> Nebula class starship.  In any case, with the Maquis Defiance's support,
>> the Roanoke would soon be Maquis.
 
MIKE: [as Eddington]  It's mine!  Do you hear?!  All mine!

>>         "Incoming hail from the Roanoke," his operations officer
>> announced.
>>         "On screen," Eddington responded, his Star Fleet training
>> evident.
 
CROW: Oh yeah, Starfleet people are the only ones who know how to put the
      words "on" and "screen" together in that situation, right?
MIKE: Starfleet Academy drills them for *months* on that until they get 
      the proper technique honed to perfection.
 
>>          All that training went out the window when Kerstin appeared on
>> screen.  He muttered, "a child, a child."
 
TOM:  My kingdom for a child!
 
>>         "Yes a child," Kerstin replied.
 
CROW: [as Kerstin]  There!  I said it!  I said it, and I'm proud!!!
 
>>                                         "Kerstin Szustakowski, Kid's
>> Crew Captain, presently in command of the USS Roanoke.  I suggest you
>> withdraw immediately."
 
MIKE: You know, sometimes I wonder if Ratliff is too subtle and too 
      infrequent in presenting the central thesis of his stories.
 
>>         "Why?  Ro informs me that your ship is currently disabled,"
 
TOM:  Actually, the ship prefers to be called "differently abled".
 
>> Eddington responded, dryly.  "You couldn't hurt a flea."
>>         "Well I may not be Marrissa Picard, 
 
MIKE: I'll grant you that, Kerstin, but right now it's kinda hard to
      tell the difference!

>>                                             but you'll find than no
>> Kid's Crew Captain has a bark worse than their bite, Mister," the young

CROW: [as Eddington]  In that case, I think it's only appropriate to 
      say ... bite me!!!
 
>>               "Roanoke out."
>> 
>>         In the classroom that was serving as the control center of the
>> Roanoke, Kerstin turned toward her tactical officer and said,
 
TOM:  [as Kerstin]  I have no idea what I'm doing!  WE'RE ALL GOING TO
      DIE!!!
 
>>                                                                "Ashaya,
>> transport one torpedo directly in front of the lead Maquis raider.  Set
>> it to explode on impact."
>>         On the classroom's view screen, a Maquis raider's nose was
>> obscured by the explosion. 
 
CROW: Got your nose...!
 
>>                            When the blast cleared, half the ship was
>> gone.
 
CROW: [as used car salesman]  We're having a *blowout* sale!  Check out 
      this used Maquis ship!  Half off!
MIKE & TOM:  Booooooooooo!
 
>>        It drifted aimlessly toward the Roanoke.
>>         "Dusty," Kerstin ordered a boy at the rear of the classroom.
 
TOM:  Ironic name there, Steve!  'Cause, see, the Maquis ship was
      blown into dust, and ... heh ....

>> "Look for known Maquis with the name Ro.  I want to know about our
>> opponent."
>>         "Kerstin, shields have gone up on all remaining vessels," a boy
>> announced.
 
TOM:  ... but soybeans are down one and a quarter.
 
>>         "They should have had them up before," Ashaya responded.

CROW: [sarcastically]  Ooooooh, are the Maquis just not as perfect as the
      great Ashaya?

>>         "Agreed," Kerstin replied.  "Send another torpedo at that
>> half-destroyed ship, I don't want it drifting into us.  Also that raider
>> at seventy mark eight looks a little weak.
 
MIKE: [as Kerstin]  Give him a trial membership at Bally's Health Club.
 
>>                                             Give him a torpedo in thirty
>> seconds."

TOM:  [as Kerstin]  There's no kill like overkill!

>>         "Aye sir," Ashaya replied.
>>         "Another vessel has arrived ...," a boy said.  "... it's the
>> Stargazer."

CROW: [as boy, in monotone]  Yay.  We're saved.

>>         On the bridge of the Stargazer, Captain T'Gwen Washington
>> surveyed the scene surrounding the Roanoke.
 
MIKE: [as Washington]  Excuse me, Mr. Scene, would you like to take a 
      survey?  How would you feel about a movie that showed George
      Wendt eating beans?
 
>>                                              A half destroyed hull blew
>> up as they watched.  The remaining ships were beginning to surround
>> the Roanoke, the Intrepid class ship being on the other side from
>> the Stargazer.

CROW: This sentence being almost incomprehensible.

>>         "Launch fighters," she ordered.  "Ops status of the Roanoke,
>> CONN plot a course to bring us along side the Intrepid Class vessel.
 
MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  Quartermaster, mints on pillows every day from now on.
 
>> Tactical fire on raiders as your phasers come to bear."
 
ALL:  Teddy Ruxpin!  NOOO!
 
>>         "The Roanoke's warp and impluse engines are offline,"  Duvek
>> responded.  "No power to phasers.  Transporter activity indicates that
>> they are using transporters to launch torpedoes."
>>         "Fascinating," 
 
CROW: That word looks *so* out of place in this story....
 
>>                        Washington responded.  "Gusat, take the upper
>> warp pair.  We are going to give who ever took the Fearless a chase.
>> Duvek, take the bridge,  I'll be in the lower warp pair.  Once we split,
 
MIKE: [as T'Gwen] ... the fighters will stay with each of us on
      alternate weekends.
 
>> I want you to move to cover the top of the Roanoke.  If you can,
>> transport security teams on board the Roanoke to clear out those Maquis.
>> Warp pair separation in one minute mark."
 
MIKE: [as Duvek]  Yes, sir.  But my name's "Duvek!"
 
>>         The Captain and First Officer left the bridge of the Stargazer,
>> and Duvek settled into the command chair.  "Rotate us 90 degrees onto
>> our port side.  Set a course looping around the raiders terminating in
>> front and facing the Fearless at separation."
 
CROW: [Duvek]  That way we'll be right in their sights just when we're 
      at our most vulnerable!
TOM:  [as helmsman]  Sir, before I set that course ... what the *HELL* 
      did you just say?!
MIKE: So, with that exciting cliffhanger, we reach the end of another
      chapter!

[SOL control room]
 
MIKE: And now, it's my pleasure to present our musical tribute to 
      Stephen Ratliff --- creator of Marrissa, her Kid's Crew and other 
      related horrors.  I have to take a few minutes to get into costume 
      for my song, so for the first musical number I'll just turn the 
      floor over to our very own Tom Servo....

[Mike sweeps his arms in Tom's direction, then exits stage left.]
 
TOM:  Thank you, Mike.  My tribute to today's experiment is adapted from 
      Johann Strauss' lovely opera, "Die Fliedermaus."  *Ahem*  The name 
      of the aria is "Premier Maquis."  Cambot, whenever you're ready....
 
[Sung to the tune of "My Dear Marqui," a.k.a. "The Laughing Song."]

     Premier Maquis
     It seems to me
     Should be thrown in the trash!
     If I may advise
     I would think it wise
     To have it burnt to ash!
 
     The story is lame and too long, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
     The intro's absurd and just wrong, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
     When Steve writes of the Kid's Crew,
     Oh, the torment we go through!
     A Corman film, you know,
     Would not abuse us so!
     A Corman film, you know,
     Would not abuse us so!
 
     Steve, you write abominably!
     You owe us an apology!
 
     What a painful ... ow!  ow!  ow!
     Situation ... ow!  ow!  ow!
     What a horrible ... ow!  ow!  ow!
     Tribulation ... ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
     What a painful ... ow!  ow!  ow!
     Situation ... ow! ow! ow!
     To see it scrolling on the screen!
 
 
[Mike returns to the SOL control room wearing the Star Trek:TNG uniform 
 from Laserblast, but with less padding at the chest.  He is also wearing 
 the blond wig from his stint as Fabio.  Crow and Tom scream in horror as 
 Mike enters and takes his place at front and center.  He kneels behind 
 the console to simulate the height of the character whose role he is now 
 playing.]
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  All right crew, listen up!  My song is about the 
      only subject worth writing about --- ME!  So shut up and give
      me center stage!  Cambot, load the tune, and ... ENGAGE!
 
[All Marrissa Wants]
[Sung to the tune of Alanis Morissette's "All I Really Want."]
 
     Do I make you retch?
     You watch as I make adults play dead and fetch
     And you say how ridiculous.
     But I wouldn't have it any other way.
     I poured strawberry juice on Worf today
     And I just love it.
     And there I go again making the pros look just like fools,
     Beating them at their own game.
     I do just what I please and I can make up my own rules.
     Who else could make the Borg Queen look tame?
 
     And all I really want is some patience
     With those who aren't as great as me.
     And all I really want is adulations.
       [Insert incomprehensible Alanis shriek here.]
 
     Do I drive you insane?
     You must wonder why I'm driven and spoiled and vain
     And consumed by the need to command.
     I love the captain's chair.
     You can boss around lowly crewmen there,
     And they jump to your every demand.
     And I am happy making sure that my will is obeyed,
     Beating up negotiators.
     And many want to shut us down, but I am not afraid.
     I make hash of Starfleet haters.
 
     And no, I never want to be a grown-up,
     'Cause maybe if I get that old
     Then they wouldn't let me be so stuck-up.
        [Insert incomprehensible Alanis shriek here.]
 
     Enough about you, let's talk about me for a minute.
     Enough about life, let's talk about me for a while.
     The conquests, the adventures, and the sound of enemies
     Falling all around... all around....
 
     Why do you guys always make fun of me?
     Here, can you handle this?
 
[Complete silence for ten seconds.  During this time, Mike holds up a
 picture of Marrissa holding a scepter while wearing royal robes and a 
 crown.  Surrounding her is a group of beings from many races.  There are
 representatives from the Federation, the Klingon, Romulan and Cardassian
 Empires, the Borg, and many others.  They are all bowing to the floor in
 front of Marrissa and they all have signs attached to their backs that 
 read:  "We were beaten by a bunch of kids."]
 
     Did I mention I'm the founder of the Kid's Crew
     And the future queen of Essex too?
     Did you know that I'm just getting started?
     And you might say I'm just a bit ambitious for my age.
     For me, things couldn't get much cooler!
     And I will fight to keep my place at front and center stage...
     If only I could rule the rulers!
 
     And all I really want is fascination
     With all the Fleet will let me do.
     And all I really want is domination.
       [Insert incomprehensible Alanis shriek here.]
 
     And what I wouldn't give for more authority
     To lord it over all I see!
     And what I wouldn't give to reach divinity!
       [Insert bone-grating Alanis banshee wail here.]
 
[As the music fades out, Mike removes his blond wig and stands up again.]
 
 
CROW: Mike ... there are no words to describe how disturbing that was.  
      But personally, I think that both of you are really giving Ratliff 
      too much of a hard time.  I think he deserves some sympathy!
 
MIKE & TOM: Huh?!?
 
CROW: That's right!  And on that note ... hit it, Cambot!
 

[Familiar sounding bongo drums play the intro as Crow sings this song 
 to the tune of the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy For The Devil."]
 
     Please allow me to introduce myself;
     A Comp Sci diploma is my goal.
     I've been around for over twenty years,
     Crushed many a man's mind and soul.
 
     I hung around on a.s.c.,
     Then I figured it was time for a change,
     'Cause far too many of the characters
     Were of post-adolescent age.
 
     Pleased to meet you!
     Hope you guessed my name!
     But let me tell you how I
     Rose to fanfic fame....
 
     I watched an episode called "Disaster,"
     Then created a disaster of my own!
     I took the kids and gave them attitudes
     And left them unchaperoned.
 
     Then I made sure the Kid's Crew
     Found enough plot holes to see them through!
 
     Pleased to meet you!
     Hope you guessed my name!
     I posted "Enterprized," and things were
     Never quite the same!
 
[Mike and Tom start singing "Woo woo!" at this point.]
 
     Now Marrissa's such a pushy girl,
     But I think she's really pretty keen!
     If I have my way, she'll draw admiral's pay
     At the ripe old age of sixteen.
 
     Let me please introduce myself,
     I'm a Comp Sci student by trade.
     I'll pick a problem that adults can't solve,
     And have Marrissa fix it right away!
 
     Pleased to meet you!
     Hope you guessed my name!
     I try for epic tales, but my
     Writing is so lame!
 
     Yes, all my villains are idiots,
     And all my heroes tots!
     Hey, at this point, just call me Ratliff,
     'Cause I'm in need of better plots!
 
     So if you meet me, have some empathy,
     Have some courtesy, and some tact!
     It could be worse, just think what I could do
     With a sitcom writing contract!
 
     Pleased to meet you!
     Hope you guessed my name!
     Yes, Stephen Ratliff's my name, and
     Verbal torture's my game!
 
[After a couple more "Woo woo!"s, cut to commercial sign with the 
 "Woo woo!"s and the music playing while the MST3K logo is on screen.]

TOM:  Maquis raiders and Federation fighters alike were blasted out of 
      existence....
 
>>             Every once in a while a torpedo would explode by a raider,
>> courtesy of the Kid's crew of the Roanoke.   
 
CROW: Yes, *please* don't let us forget about them for even a moment, 
      Stephen.
MIKE: [female announcer voice]  The white courtesy torpedoes are located 
      on the starboard hull.

>>                                              Meanwhile Marrissa's red

MIKE: ... who, being omnipotent, didn't require a fighter or a spacesuit 
      to fly through space.
 
>>                                      pursued targets among the raiders,
>> sowing confusion where ever they went.
 
TOM:  Much like Ratliff does with his stories.
 
>>         Then suddenly, the Stargazer took on the appearance of a
>> collision course, full impluse.  
 
CROW: But actually it was a well-disguised full retreat!
 
>>                                  "Separation in 10 ... 9 ..."  Closer
>> and faster they went.  Collision emanate.  "6 ...  7 ..."
 
TOM:  Which way is time flowing again?
MIKE: Collisions began to emanate from the Stargazer!  Nobody was really
      sure why or how....
 
>>         On the Bridge of the Maquis Defiance, a.k.a. the Fearless, 
 
CROW: a.k.a. the Wackiest Ship in the Maquis!
 
>>                                                                    the
>> operations officer announced, "The Stargazer is on a collision course.
>> Impact in ten seconds."
>>         "Evasive," Eddington got out, too late for the helmsman to
>> respond.
 
MIKE: [as helmsman]  Duh, got to wait for duh command before I move 
      duh ship.
 
>>         On the screen, the sideways ship closed, then suddenly the warp
>> engines pealed off.  
 
TOM:  Peals of laughter emanate from the readers as Ratliff botches yet
      another homonym.
 
>>                      The saucer itself stopped.  The warp pairs made
>> organized strikes down the sides of the Intrepid Class Maquis vessel, 
 
MIKE: Management Unfair!
TOM:  Better working conditions!
CROW: Longer coffee breaks!

>>                                                                       as
>> the crew continued to stare.  The saucer then made a corkscrew turn back
>> toward the Roanoke, righting itself and tossing a volley of torpedoes at
>> the Fearless, almost absentmindedly.
 
MIKE: [absentmindedly]  Think I'll send a few megatons of destruction in 
      that direction.  Hope I hit an enemy or something....

>>         "Shields at 50 percent," the tactical officer announced.
>>         "Follow the saucer," Eddington ordered.
 
TOM:  [as Eddington]  Leave the dish and the spoon for the raiders!
 
>>                                                  "We'll see if we can
>> retrieve our strike team before we leave."
>> 
 
CROW: [as Eddington]  We need them at the Detroit plants on Sunday!
 
>>         Meanwhile, Marrissa's two wings of fighters were after the
>> eleven remaining raiders.  She and Lieutenant Matt Grubb (blue wing's
>> commanding officer) were busy directing their forces.  
 
TOM:  "'Marrissa's Massacre XXIV,' scene 5, take 1.  Action!"

>>                                                        "Picard to Red
>> two, watch your back."
 
MIKE: [as Red Two]  I can't.  I'm too busy watching the enemy ships!
 
>>         "I see him, Commander."

CROW: Luke!  Pull up!

>>         "Red four to Red five, you've got a tail"
 
MIKE: [as Red Five]  Well, sure, so do all Caitians, but why bring it up 
      now?  Species-centric thinking is outlawed in the 24th Century!
 
>>         "I can't shake him."
 
CROW: Cover me, Porkins!
TOM:  I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that Ratliff has seen Star Wars
      a few times.
 
>>         "Picard to Red Three, Four, Six,  relieve Five of his tail.
 
TOM:  Ensign Gekko will grow a new one in a few days, anyway.

>> I'll be joining you."
>>         Marrissa turned her fighter from the raider she had been
>> following toward the raider causing Red Five trouble.  She noted this
>> course would cause her to pass between the secondary hull saucer of the
>> Nebula class starship.  
 
CROW: ... between the hull ... and what??
 
>>                         As she closed, she noticed that the Maquis
>> raider in question's rear shields were lit up like a firefly.  
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  Saaaaaaayyyyy....  Check out the rear shields on 
      *that* raider!  Rrrroooowwww....
 
>>                                                                 She
>> crossed the saucer of the Roanoke and came out in front of the raider

>> raider, 
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Another infidel falls before my wrath!
 
>>          as it exploded and Red Three, Four, and Six peeled out of the
>> cloud of expanding gas that it left behind.
>>         "Black Leader to Fighter Commander," Dar Ducat's voice came.
 
TOM:  Go ahead, Louis Farrakhan.
 
>> "Black and Green joining up.  Where do you want us?"
>>         "Black odds take raider five," Marrissa began  "Black even,
>> raider six, Green odd, seven, 
 
CROW: Wow, it's a good thing those Maquis raiders all have bright red
      numbers painted on their hulls.
TOM:  Yeah.
 
>>                                Green even, eight,  Red even reassigned to
>> nine, Red odd, four, leaders assist as necessary your wings."
 
MIKE: Ratliff, adjust as necessary your syntax.
CROW: I'd lay even odds that nobody gives a crap about all these 
      assignments.
TOM:  I think Marrissa's plan is to confuse all the fighter pilots and 
      make them crash into each other, so that she can take all the 
      credit for the inevitable victory.
 
>>         "Blue two to Commander, raider two is gone."
>>         "Take raider ten Blue even.  Leaders take raider eleven.
 
TOM:  Muppets, take Manhattan!
CROW: Steve Miller, take the money and run!
 
>>                                                                 Let's
>> clear these guys out."
 
MIKE: Well guys, once again Marrissa is directing a vastly superior 
      force to mercilessly obliterate her foes.
TOM:  One of the constants that brings order to the Ratliverse, you know.
 
>> 
>>         Three fighters on each Maquis Raider left little that the Maquis
>> could do, as raider after raider found itself losing.
 
MIKE: Yeah, Oakland's really been struggling this year.
 
>>                                                         Meanwhile the

TOM:  ... until it could respond with at least a three of a kind.
 
>> Unable to close on the Roanoke,
 
MIKE: ... the Defiance decided to look for another ship with a lower asking
      price in a better neighborhood.
 
>>                                  the Defiance hit warp, exiting with the

>>         The saucer, confined to impluse, 
 
TOM:  ... felt awkward and lonely as it was left behind by its faster 
      classmates....
 
>>                                          took up guard above the
>> Roanoke.  The red and blue wings returned to the fighter bay, by

>> 
>>         Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard returned to the bridge.
 
CROW: What, don't we get another thrilling stair-climbing scene?!

>> "Status, Duvek?" she asked, as he yielded command to her.
>>         "The warp pairs are still after the Maquis vessel," Duvek began.
>> "No sign of any additional Maquis.  Ship is secure."
 
TOM:  Battle sequences are plagiarized.

>>         "Excellent, hail the Roanoke," Marrissa ordered.  
 
CROW: "Excellent"?  Weird name for a communications officer....
 
>>                                                           Kerstin
>> Szustakowski appeared once again 
 
TOM:  ... in her one-woman show: "My Life as a Kid's Crew Officer and
      Mistress of the Universe."
 
>>                                   from her classroom.  "Kerstin, I must

>>         "Thank you Commander," Kerstin blushed.
>>         "I think it's time to get rid of that occupation you're
>> suffering,"  Marrissa replied.  
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Your new occupation is ship's janitor.
TOM:  What about *our* suffering?
 
>>                                 "Would you mind if I removed them from
>> the Bridge and Engineering of your ship?"

TOM:  With wording like that, Ratliff can easily get a job translating
      Japanese instructions if his computer career doesn't pan out....

>>         "Those uninvited guests?  Take them," Kerstin said, relieved.
 
CROW: Take my Maquis invaders.  Please!

MIKE: The adults have *effectively* been out since "Enterprized."
 
>>         "Doctor Johnson will be over shortly," Marrissa replied.
>> "Stargazer out."
 
CROW: [as Kerstin]  Make sure he brings the Snoopy Band-Aids and the 
      chewable children's aspirin!

>> Captain's Log

>> Stardate 51381.89
>> Captain T'Gwen Washington commanding.

ALL:  Saaaaay!
 
>>         Lieutenant Commander Picard had, in our absence, retaken the
>> bridge and other occupied areas of the Roanoke.  
 
CROW: ... in a very dramatic and action-packed scene that we don't feel 
      like showing you.
MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  The security personnel we sent over may have fired a 
      shot or two, but it was really Marrissa's doing, pretty much!
 
>>                                                  Doctor Johnson has
>> filled our sickbay, and theirs with the Roanoke's comatose crew.  He

>> recommends a week's recovery period.

TOM:  Ironically, after being out cold for hours, they need rest!

>>         Per Picard's recommendation, I have left young Szustakowski in
>> command of the Roanoke.  
 
CROW: Like Marrissa would ever recommend anything else!
TOM:  [as T'Gwen]  I was going to object to such a nonsensical idea,
      but Marrissa used some odorless, invisible gas on me which destroyed 
      my logical abilities and rendered me a soulless vehicle for her 
      ambitions.
 
>>                          We are returning to Deep Space Nine with much
>> to ponder.
 
MIKE: Why did our last battle resemble so closely the fighter sequences
      from "Star Wars"?
TOM:  Why do untrained children wind up in command so *bloody* often?
CROW: Who put the "bop" in the "bop-she-bop-she-bop"...?
ALL:  [singing]  Who put the "ram" in the "ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong"...?

>> 
>>         Marrissa, Doctor Johnson, Ross and Kathy Lochard, and Lieutenant
>> Lavelle were in Seven Slightly Starboard 

TOM:  Mike, please, I'm begging you.  Kill me now.  Have mercy, man!
MIKE: Oh, I can't do that, Servo!  Remember what Nietzsche said, 
      "Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger."
TOM:  Yeah, but Nietzsche never had to read eleven Ratliff stories!

>>         "I'll see you and raise you 10," Kathy responded.  "But all the
>> command crew sans the doctor were left behind.
>>         "So the doctor did it," Lavelle replied.
 
TOM:  No, he was framed by The Master.
MIKE: How does that go?  "Once you have eliminated the impossible, 
      whatever remains, however implausible, must be Ratliff"?
 
>>         "I don't think so," Doctor Johnson commented.  "We don't have

TOM:  I spindle!
CROW: I mutilate!
 
>>         "Then the agent stayed behind," Lavelle suggested.
>>         "I'm going to have to shoot that one down, Sam," Marrissa said.
>> "See you and raise you twenty."
>>         "Too rich for me," Ross folded.  
 
MIKE: [as Ross]  I'm trying to lose a few pounds, you know how it is....
 
>>                                          "I have to agree with you on
>> one point, Sam.  Someone had to have lots of clearance to pull that one
>> off."
 
CROW: One low-hanging bridge would have ruined the whole thing....
TOM:  You know, if I ever see Marrissa taking up chess and the next day 
      beating grand-masters, I think I'll just end it all.
 
>>         "You mean they didn't just take her like they tried to do to the
>> Roanoke," Kathy queried.
>>         "The ship was functioning too good for that to be the case,"
>> Ross stated.
 
MIKE: What?  They warped in, sat there, took a pounding for a while, then 
      warped out again.
 
>>         "That's what I thought," Lavelle confirmed.  "I'll see and raise
>> 20."
>>         "I fold," Kathy responded.  "If not the command crew then who?"
 
CROW: Horton?
TOM:  "If not now, then when?"
 
>>         "I'll see your 20, Sam, and raise you 30," Marrissa called.  "I
>> have a couple suspicions on that."
>>         "Oh?" Sam Lavelle responded.  "Who?  I'll see you and raise you
>> 40."
 
MIKE: Thrill as the Stargazer poker club pulls out all the stops in a
      no-holds-barred bidding frenzy!
TOM:  Wow, somebody's going to leave this game *completely* stripped of 
      all their meaningless little hunks of plastic.
 
>>         "Admiral Ellis," Marrissa answered.  "I see you and raise you
>> 50."
>>         "Ellis? really Marrissa," Kathy remarked.
 
CROW: Wow!  Admiral Ellis is really Marrissa?  This changes everything!
 
>>         "Yeah, what have you got against him?" Ross asked.
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Oh, nothing much.  Just a few compromising pictures
      of Ellis and a Denebian sand goat.  Wanna see?
 
>>         "I fold," Lavelle said.
>>         Marrissa pulled in the pot and replied, 
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  This is only for medical purposes.  I don't inhale.
 
>>                                                     "He failed to send a
>> rescue party to the Roanoke when Kerstin requested one."
>>         "That sounds like a good enough reason," Doctor Johnson
>> concurred.  "Is anyone charging him?"

CROW: No, they're paying cash for him.

>>         "I've asked the JAG office to look into the matter," Marrissa
>> responded.
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  But they kept trying to sell me a luxury car, so
      I'm going to try something else.
 
>>             "Well gentlemen, I've got Alpha shift tomorrow, so I'll be
>> going now."
 
CROW: So I guess that makes Marrissa the alpha bi....
MIKE: [sets his hand on Crow's shoulder]  Uh uh.

>>         "Quitting while your ahead, I see," Ross Lochard stated.
>>         "Always, Lieutenant, first rule of tactics," Marrissa smiled.
 
ALL:  [great peals of laughter]
MIKE: What would Sun Tzu or von Clausewitz say to that one?
TOM:  Sure, give up while you've got an advantage and give the enemy a
      chance to catch up.  Good rule, Marrissa!
 
>> "And don't get too loud tonight, my room is right on the other side of
>> that wall."
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  No fun of any kind is allowed on my ship unless I'm
      personally involved!
CROW: Don't get me angry.  You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
 
>> 
>>         Former Star Fleet Lieutenant Ro Laren sat in the brig of the
>> Roanoke.  She wondered why she always took the hard assignments.  
 
TOM:  Differential equations, quantum field theory, organic chemistry....
MIKE  [as Ro]  I guess I nevah... EVAH... do anything NICE and EASY! 
      [singing]  Rollin'!  Rollin'!  Rollin' down the riiiii-vaaaaahhh!!!
CROW: [shudders]  Mike, that was scary enough the first time....
TOM:  But at least he's not wearing that outfit.
 
>>                                                                   Taking

TOM:  Things to do today: Do laundry.  Buy milk.  Hijack a Starfleet
      warship.
CROW: [as Ro]  Steal a starship?!  Who put *that* in the syllabus?
 
>>                                                                    Now
>> she was paying for it.  
 
MIKE: [falsetto]  Young lady, that ship you stole is coming right out of
      your allowance!
 
>>                        On the eve of Maquis Independence, here she sat
>> in the brig of a Star Fleet vessel.

CROW: [as Ro]  And I'm missing the fireworks show!

>>         "You don't look like you're having fun," a young voice stated.
 
MIKE: [as young voice]  And for that ... you must die.
TOM:  [as the Alpha Complex computer]  Happiness is mandatory, citizen.
      Are *YOU* happy?
 
>> Standing outside her cell was a young girl in a red and blue
>> Starfleet-like uniform.  Ro wondered who it was.
>>         "No I'm not," Ro commented.
>>         "It's a shame really," the girl responded.  "You certainly
>> seemed to be having fun yesterday."

TOM:  [as Kerstin]  You were turning cartwheels and cracking jokes with 
      your fellow hijackers and everything!

>>         "You mean when I tried to take over this ship," Ro replied.
>> "That wasn't fun, that was duty."
>>         "Who said it wasn't possible to do both?" the girl asked.
 
CROW: [as Kerstin]  Girl, you can bring home the bacon *and* fry it up 
      in a pan!
MIKE: [as Kerstin]  Once you unlock the power of your inner child, you 
      can steal Starfleet ships *much* more effectively!
 
>>         "I've never been able to," Ro answered.
 
TOM:  Okay, who are you and what have you done with the *real* Ro Laren?

      personality under control with Ratliff gas....
 
>>         "That's really a shame," the girl commented.  "I've had fun
>> almost every time I've been on duty.  
 
CROW: [as Kerstin]  Especially when I destroyed your ships, made your
      colleagues die an agonizing fiery death, and watched their mangled, 
      lifeless corpses drift in the icy vacuum of space.  That was lots 
      of fun!

>>                                       Unless you count that Greiluse
>> treaty.  That gave me a headache."
 
CROW: Greiluse treaties burn my gut!
MIKE: [as Kerstin]  I had to head-butt the representatives from both
      sides into submission.

>>         "Who are you anyway?" Ro inquired.
 
MIKE: I'm Bat-brat!

>>         "Kerstin Szustakowski, acting Captain," the girl informed.
>>         "I leave and Star Fleet goes to the kids," Ro grumbled.
>> "Shouldn't you be on the bridge or something?"
 
TOM:  No, she shouldn't ... and everyone but Ratliff seems to know it!
 
>>         "No, it's Beta shift," Kerstin replied.  "I'm doing my tour of
>> the ship.  It's been nice talking to you, Miss Ro."  The girl Captain
>> walked off.
 
TOM:  ... skipping and whistling a happy tune of death and destruction on
      galactic scales.
MIKE: [sarcastically]  Well, if that little visit doesn't cheer Ro up, I
      don't know what will!
 
>> 
>>         Captain T'Gwen Washington and Glinn Gusat sat in the Stargazer's
>> ready room.  

CROW: ... or readied in the Stargazer's Sat Room.

>>              Already, the room was beginning to take on the personality
>> of the half-Vulcan Captain.  
 
CROW: Wooden, shallow, and poorly written?
TOM:  A lifeless automaton submissive to Marrissa's ambitions?
 
>>                               A painting of the Vulcan's Forge graced one
>> wall, with the Captain's saber hung below it.  A copy of Decartes's La
>> Geometrie sat under glass on a table.  
 
TOM:  Yeah, Rene Descartes ... now *there* was a man who really knew
      all the angles!
MIKE: [groans]
 
>>                                        A stand by the door had the
>> traditional model of Washington's last command,
 
MIKE: It was a replica of the words: "Evasive action, quickly!"
 
>>                                                  the Miranda.
>>         "So Glinn, what do you think of the Stargazer now," Washington
>> asked.
 
CROW: [as announcer]  How much would you pay for a starship like this?
      Don't answer, because you also get this amazing vinyl repair kit!
 
>>         "Where can Cardassia purchase one?" Glinn Gusat replied.
 
TOM:  [as announcer]  At the friendly Dodge dealer nearest you!
 
>>                                                                  "I've
>> never seen such a versatile vessel.  Fighters, those warp pair craft,
>> and I've never seen such a large vessel corner so well."
 
MIKE: [as announcer]  With all of these features and more, the new
      Stargazer once again redefines the driving experience!
CROW: Clearly, it's the most astonishing vessel the author's mind ever 
      devised.
TOM:  Actually, if you'll remember, it's the most astonishing vessel the 
      author's *brother* ever devised!
 
>>         "Well, when the refitter has been around 150 years, he learns
>> some things," Captain Washington remarked.
 
TOM:  Like where to buy Depends in bulk.

>>         "Vulcan?"
 
CROW: [as T'Gwen]  No thanks, I'm trying to cut back....
 
>>         "No, Admiral Scott's human," Washington replied.  "He spent a
>> quarter of a century as Captain Kirk's Chief Engineer."
>>         "James T. Kirk?"
 
CROW: [as T'Gwen, sarcastically]  No, *Shirley* Kirk, the *other* famous 
      Starfleet captain!  Who do you think?!
 
>>         "The same.  Scott is a certified genius.  
 
TOM:  [as T'Gwen]  But ever since we had to put him in a home, he's
      just certified.
 
>>                                                  He's spent the last
>> couple years figuring out how to upgrade our older starships.  He did
>> such a good job converting the Constellation class into the Stargazer
>> class
 
TOM:  [singing]: ... that now he is the ruler of the Queen's navy!
 
>>       that they're thinking of giving him the Nova Class project."
>>         "Shouldn't he be retiring soon?"
>>         "He did once.  Reportably he couldn't stand it."
 
MIKE: [as T'Gwen]  Either that, or his family couldn't stand him taking
      up space on their couch.  I forget which.
TOM:  "Reportably"?  Now he's just making words up!

MIKE: [as Sisko]  Our ratings have improved ever since we started this

CROW: [as Sisko]  Unfortunately, now they're back aboard my station!
      Oh, where's that bloodwine when I need it...?
 
>>         As a result of this attempt, several Maquis have been captured.
 
TOM:  [as Sisko]  And, as expected, the secretary has disavowed any
      knowledge of their actions.
 
>> They include a former Bajoran Star Fleet Officer, Ro Laren. 
 
CROW: If she's not Bajoran anymore, what is she?
 
>>                                                              This Ro

CROW: ... inside her head.
TOM:  [as voice]  You must kill them all!  Kill everyone who stands in
      your way!
 
>>                  from behind her.  "Too busy to even stop and chat with

MIKE: [as Marrissa]  No ... too stuck up!
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  "Friend"?  What's that?
 
>>                   Marrissa spun around looking for the owner of the voice.
>> She spotted the blond teenager sitting at a table in the Replimat which

MIKE: [as Vader]  Together we will rule the galaxy!

>>         "Jay, what are you doing here?" Marrissa inquired, as she sat
>> down across from Jay.
 
MIKE: [as Jay]  Eating dinner.  Duh!
 
>>         "Captain Sisko asked for some back-up, after the Maquis declared

TOM:  [as Jay]  Ironic, huh?

>>         "I see you got your full Lieutenancy," Marrissa observed.  "What
>> did you have to do to get it?"
 
CROW: [as Jay]  Oh, you know how it is ... "You die, and we all move up 
      in rank...."
 
>>         "You're looking at the Independence's new Chief of Operations,"
>> Jay beamed.
>>         "I thought that was your father's position," Marrissa commented.
 
MIKE: [as Jay]  Oh, I forgot to mention, he died a grisly death on some 
      mission or other.  I don't remember much about it, except that it
      made room for my advancement.  Ho hum.
 
>>         "He got bumped up to First Officer," Jay said, smiling.  "We
>> were out of range of replacements, so Captain Morris appointed me.  Why
>> me I have no idea, after all I'm leaving for the Academy in six months."
 
TOM:  Why you?  Why any of these little brats?!?  Why should one more
      gratuitous promotion make any difference?
 
>>         "Because Jay, you're good at organization, that's why I made you
>> my number one back in the Enterprise's Kid's Crew," Marrissa said.
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Just one look at your sock drawer and I knew you
      belonged at second-in-command!
 
>>         "Speaking of the Kid's Crew on the old Enterprise, 
 
MIKE: [as Jay]  What in the heck was Jean-Luc Picard smoking, anyway?!

>>                                                            how is Clara
>> doing in command?" Jay asked.
>>         "My father left her and the Kid's Crew in command while he went
>> to talk to Admiral Necheyev on Starbase 12," Marrissa began.  
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  Dad's still as dumb as ever!
 
>>                                                               "You know,
>> low risk watch, not much chance of trouble."
>>         "You mean the kind of watch that Kid's Crew Captains turn into
>> great adventures?" Jay said.

MIKE: "Great adventure"?  Isn't that how the army describes slogging 
      through hip-deep mud and getting your limbs blown off?

>>                                "Usually beginning with an attack by some
>> enemy of the Federation."

CROW: [as Jay]  By some stupid-but-evil alien who can be mercilessly wiped
      out by superior forces for the advancement of our own careers?
MIKE: Actually, it usually begins with some ASCII art, or a lame quote,
      followed by a few acknowledgments.
 
>>         "You've heard this story before," Marrissa accused.  
 
TOM:  We *all* have.  Over and over and over and over.
MIKE: Stephen, you are merciless.
 
>>                                                               "The
>> Romulans sent their annual attempt to destroy a starship toward Starbase
>> 12 this year."
 
TOM:  Wacky old Romulans.  You can set your calendar by them.
CROW: Isn't it nice how the Federation lets the Romulans prance across
      their border every year and doesn't declare war on them?  I wonder
      why the Romulans aren't so tolerant?
 
>>         "So how did Clara do?" Jay asked.
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  It was the strangest thing.  She acted like a scared
      kid with way too much responsibility thrust upon her in a dangerous
      and unfamiliar situation.  If highly trained adult officers hadn't
      been nearby, thousands of lives would have been lost.  I just don't
      understand it.
 
>>         "Quite well, much to her surprise," Marrissa mused.  "She neatly
>> clipped off the engines of the Warbird and captured it."
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa, muttering]  Weak-kneed bleeding-heart liberal pansy!
      If it had been me, I would have racked up 500 more kills!
 
>>         "So is she still claiming that she's an Engineer, not a Starship
>> Commander?" Jay inquired.
>>         "Of course," Marrissa confirmed.  "Not that anyone believes that
>> Engineering is her only talent after that performance."
 
MIKE: I *know*....
 
>>         "I hope not," Jay responded.  "So how are you doing?"
>>         "Let's see, my department is a nightmare, Cardassian personnel
>> feuding with Star Fleet personnel.  
 
MIKE: [as Star Fleeter]  Bony-ridged freak!
CROW: [as Cardassian]  Pajama-wearing wimp!
TOM:  [as announcer]  On your marks!  Let's start... THE GALAXY FEUD!!!
CROW  [imitates game show theme music]
MIKE: [as Richard Dawson]  Top five answers are on the board... name
      something that Ratliff does regularly in his fanfic stories
      that fills his readers with loathing and disbelief.  Crow?
 
>>                                     My quarters are next to the ship's
>> bar, which means I hear all of the bar fights, and the Stargazer seems

CROW: [as contestant]  Uh... long-winded, stilted conversations about
      topics that nobody cares about?
MIKE: [as Richard Dawson]  Survey says... 
ALL:  BUZZZT!
MIKE: [as Richard Dawson]  Nope!  Not a top answer!  Tom Servo, your 
      chance to steal!

ALL:  WHAT?!?
[short pause]
ALL:  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
TOM:  [as contestant]  I think I've got it, Richard....  How about
      putting Marrissa in a position of responsibility that she has
      neither the age nor experience to handle properly?
MIKE: [as Richard Dawson]  NUMBER ONE ANSWER!!!
 
>>         "Would that be Ro Laren?" Jay asked.
>>         "It would," Marrissa confirmed.
>>         "Perhaps I can help," Jay remarked.

TOM:  Sure, why not?  This situation hasn't become ridiculous enough
      yet!!!
CROW: What happened, did every member of Starfleet's JAG office suddenly
      come down with the Venusian flu?
MIKE: That, or more Ratliff gas....

>>                                             "Since I've become Chief of
>> Operations, I've defended four people."
>>         "How good are you?" Marrissa inquired.
 
MIKE: [as Jay]  Why don't you come back to my quarters and find out?
 
>>         "I'm four for four," Jay smiled.
 
MIKE: [as Jay]  Four trials, four executions!  That's good, right?

>> 
>>         Lieutenant Ro Laren sat back against the wall of her cell on
>> Deep Space Nine.  Her knees bent, with an arm causally resting on it,
 
MIKE: Wow, this is either getting into really deep metaphysical territory,
      or Ratliff still can't spell.
 
>> she contemplated her fate.  She hoped they had got the west wing air

>> time in prison.  
 
TOM:  [as announcer]  Tonight on "Hard Copy": Shocking footage of
      Federation prison conditions....
 
>>                 After all she was being court-martialed for attempted
>> take over of a starship and numerous other things she had done as a
>> Maquis.
 
MIKE: But worst of all, they were *really* going to nail her for the
      times she exceeded Warp 5 with non-refined engines!
 
>>         As she mused over this, a young blond lady entered in a red Star
>> Fleet uniform.  "Ro Laren?" the blond inquired.
>>         "Yes?" Ro replied
 
TOM:  Yo!  Ro!
CROW: Oh, like she's never heard that one before.
 
>>         "I'm Marrissa Picard, I'll be your defense attorney," she
>> replied.

CROW: [as Marrissa]  And I've got a 21:14 Kobayashi Maru time, so you've
      got nothing to worry about!
TOM:  [as Ro]  Look, let's save a little time here.  Just take me down
      to the lethal injection chair right now and get it over with, okay?
 
>>         "I remember you," Ro commented.  "You're the girl that got the
>> Ensign's rank at age 12.  I know some non-coms that didn't like that."
 
CROW: I know some readers who didn't like it.
MIKE: [as Ro]  Can you get me to a comm unit?  They'd *really* like to
      know you're here now....
 
>>         "I know," Marrissa responded.  "There are even a couple officers
>> who are resenting the speed at which I've been promoted.  
 
CROW: [snickering]  A couple?  I think Marrissa's being *very* optimistic
      in that assessment.
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  Ha ha, it's so much fun watching the little people
      go on and on about their pathetic little lives!
 
>>                                                           Never mind the
>> fact that I've protested them all, with the exception of this last one
>> to Lieutenant Commander."
 
TOM:  Yeah, her reluctance to command everyone around her *really*
      shines through in Ratliff's stories, doesn't it?
 
>>         "They put you on the fast track," Ro smiled.  "I've been on it,
>> twice.  Its not easy is it?"
>>         "No, sometimes I feel like I'm under a magnifying glass,"
 
ALL:  MORE SUNLIGHT!  MORE SUNLIGHT!

>> Marrissa stated.  "And if you make the slightest error ..."
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  ... you brutally destroy all witnesses!
 
>>         "They jump on you like a two year does with a spider on a
>> sidewalk," Ro finished.
 
CROW: But enough about those guys on the Satellite of Love!
MIKE: Ba-DUM-bum!
 
>>                         "Just be glad you haven't wound up in prison
>> yet."
 
TOM:  [as Ro]  Just be glad you have an author that constantly twists
      logic and the laws of the universe for you.
 
>>         "Do I sense a defeatist attitude?" Marrissa asked.  "I shouldn't
>> be, after all I believe I can get you off."
 
BOTS:  [you know the music]  BWOW-ka-chicka-chicka-BWOW-WOW!
 
>>         Ro laughed, "Right."
>>         "Right," Marrissa replied.  "After all, you can't be
>> court-martialed in an organization which you were not a part of at the
>> time of the crime."
 
CROW: But then she'll have to be tried by the Federation as a *civilian* 
      for attempted theft, sabotage, espionage and terrorism!  Great plan, 
      Marrissa!
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  Hey, at least the case will be out of *my* hair, then!
      As if I really have time to deal with the legal squabblings of mere
      mortals!
 
>>         "You're serious aren't you," Ro commented.
>>         "My father considered your message to then Commander Riker as a
>> resignation," Marrissa informed.  "That takes care of all but the charge

>>         "How did you get level 15 clearance?" Ro asked.  "That's usually
>> associated with a full Admiral's rank!"
>>         "The clearance is 
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa] ... yet another mind-bogglingly improbable
      contrivance I've encountered on my quest for ultimate power.  I've 
      learned not to question them any more.
 
>>                            federation wide clearance," Marrissa stated.
>> "Star Fleet Clearance is a yes or no question.
 
CROW: [as Ro]  Well, okay, that clears things up, I... huh?!?
 
>>                                                 As an officer, I've got
>> Star Fleet clearance.  As the next in line to be head of state of a
>> member planet, or heir to Essex, I've got the level 15.  It's a weakness
>> of the system."
 
CROW: And we're supposed to believe that Starfleet Command is too 
      mind-bogglingly stupid to fix such a gaping hole?
MIKE: Remember, this is Federation security we're talking about.
CROW: Oh.  Yeah.
 
>>         "So, Commander, have you done this before?" Ro inquired,
>> smiling.
 
ALL:  [everyone clears throats loudly]
TOM:  Shouldn't this have been posted in alt.startrek.creative.erotica?
MIKE: And how do *you* know about *that*?
 
>>         "No, not as defense counsel," Marrissa replied.
 
TOM:  In a *good* story, this would be the defendant's cue to request
      new counsel!

>> Marrissa responded.
>> 
>>         Lieutenant Katherine Lochard was talking to her sister, Virginia
>> Szustakowski, the new Chief Engineer of the Stargazer, at Deep Space
>> Nine's Replimat.  "You'll enjoy Commander Picard, Gina" 
 
MIKE: Apparently, Gina is a dyed-in-the-wool masochist.
 
>>                                                          Kathy commented.
>> "She hasn't lost that child's sense of fun.  
 
TOM:  [sarcastically]  How unusual to still have child-like qualities
      when you're still a child!
 
>>                                              One word of warning,
>> though, don't call her, Risa.  Ross keeps making that mistake and ending
>> up with strawberry juice all over his uniform and hair."
 
CROW: Marrissa is *not* a well person.
TOM:  Nope. 
MIKE: Uh-uh.
 
>>         "Sounds like fun," Virginia replied.  "The second on the
>> Fearless was pure terror.  You never knew what he was going to complain
>> about next."  
 
MIKE: [as 2nd officer]  Virginia Szustakowski?  Your name's too long!
TOM:  [as Virginia]  I mean, really!  Just because I blew up the warp
      core!  *Anyone* could make *that* mistake!
 
>>               As she said this, Gina noticed her youngest sister,
>> Kerstin coming towards them.  "Oh, here comes Kerstin the cursed
>> Captain."
>>         "Don't let her hear you say that," Kathy said.  "She's been
>> known to beat people up for that."
 
CROW: Stephen Ratliff's not a well person either, is he?
MIKE: Well ... that's kind of harsh.  He's unusual, sure, but at least 
      he's found a harmless way to live out these fantasies of his.
CROW: You call *this* "harmless?"
 
>>         "Someone mention my nickname?" Kerstin stated from behind Kathy.
>> Kathy blushed.  "Don't worry, I know it was used in a good way.
 
TOM:  [as Kerstin]  So you get to live ... *THIS* time....
 
>>                                                                   I'd
>> rather you call me that than having Mom."
>>         "How is Mother," Gina asked.
 
MIKE: [as Gina]  I haven't checked on her myself and I'm not really 
      interested, but as long as we're on the topic you might as well tell
      me.
 
>>         "She's been relieved of duty for the next week," Kerstin
>> informed.  "Doctor Johnson of the Stargazer wants her to have time to
>> recover.  
 
CROW: And the author wants to keep pre-adolescents in command for a while
      longer.
 
>>           She's already tried to have Doctor Bashir overrule him.
>> Apparently Bashir had been informed that she would try."
>>         "I told Johnson," Kathy responded.  "But don't tell Mom."
 
CROW: ... the Babysitter's Dead.
TOM:  When did this fanfic become a soap opera?
 
>>         "Don't tell me what?" Captain Mary Szustakowski asked,
 
MIKE: [as Mary]  Are you two little ragamuffins conspiring against me
      again?
 
>> approaching with her four remaining daughters.
>>         "Mom, you were supposed to be resting in your quarters," Kerstin
>> stated.
>>         "I couldn't stand it, so I decided to do a little shopping,"

MIKE: [as Mary]  Compulsive shopping helps me to forget the pain of having
      my own children show me up in the command chair!!!

>> Mary replied, gesturing to her daughters 
 
TOM:  Her nameless, voiceless, automaton daughters....
MIKE: The Throwaway Girls!
 
>>                                          who where carrying various
>> packages.
 
TOM:  ... silently, not talking or making eye contact with anyone,
      including their own sisters.
CROW: Tommy, you're creeping me out here....
 
>>         "Well at least you got someone to carry the packages," Virginia
>> commented.
>>         "Mom, you should really rest," Katherine stated, seriously.
 
TOM:  [as Katherine]  Go back home and sleep it off, Mom!
 
>> "Kerstin, your still acting Captain of the Roanoke, aren't you?"
>>         "Yes, Why?" Kerstin replied.
 
MIKE: Uh oh, here it comes....
CROW: This is Ratliff's opportunity to *really* peg the dysfunctionality
      meter.
 
>>         "Confine her to quarters, if she disobeys, try the brig," Kathy
>> said.  
 
CROW: Mike, this fixation Ratliff has in all his stories, about young
      children having authority over their parents and giving them 
      orders?
MIKE: Yes?
CROW: It's wrong, isn't it?
MIKE: Deeply and fundamentally, Crow.
CROW: Just checking.
 
>> "She is not going to get well shopping on DS9.  Mom, I haven't
>> seen you this pale since right after you fought that Cardassian in
>> hand-to-hand combat, just four days after you gave birth to Kerstin."
 
MIKE: Wow.  HMO's are *really* strict in the 24th century.
 
>>         "How could you remember that?" Mary asked, palefaced.
>>         "I was 12 years old at the time," Katherine responded.  "As I
>> recall, you came back missing the upper half of your uniform and with a
>> rather large gash in your side."
 
TOM:  Yuck.  I did *not* need that mental image.
 
>>         Captain Mary Szustakowski paled more at the memory as Kerstin
>> spoke up, "Captain Mary Szustakowski, as of this Stardate, you are
>> confined to quarters.  
 
CROW: [as Kerstin]  Go to your room, Mom!
TOM:  [as announcer]  This little playlet has been brought to you by 
      "Toughlove."  It's not just for parents anymore!
 
>>                        You will remain there until such a time as you
>> are declared fit by Medical personnel.
 
TOM: [as Kerstin]  And you *stay* there without supper until my sister
     and I call you back down!

>>                                         Lieutenants Lochard and
>> Szustakowski, would you see to her confinement?  I'm expected in Ops."
 
MIKE: [as Kerstin]  I know you think I'm just being a bitch right now,
      Mother, but you'll thank me for this when you're older.
TOM:  Yes, here we see the compassionate side of the Kid's Crew's
      inherently bossy nature.  We hope you folks at home were just as
      touched by it as we were.

[SOL control room]
 
[Tom and Crow are leaning over the desk, which is filled with small 
 plastic model buildings, trees, etc.]
 
TOM:  [to Crow]  ... and this jungle area will be the shooting range, 
      with lots of pop-up cardboard targets.
 
[Mike walks in.]
 
MIKE: Guys, have you seen Gypsy?  There's an awful racket coming 
      from the cargo.... [notices the desk]  What's all this?
 
CROW: Well, Mike, we got to thinking, what if Ratliff's vision of 
      reality is not unique?  What if *lots* of boys and girls back
      on Earth want to experience the world the way Marrissa Amber
      Flores Picard does?
 
MIKE: Crow, I realize you bots haven't had much chance to witness normal 
      human childhood, but....
 
TOM:  Oh, give us some credit, Mike.  We know that Ratliff's characters
      are pure fiction.  Otherwise, the Earth would have become a 
      smoking ruin years ago. 
 
[Mike leans over the desk and starts examining the models carefully.]
 
TOM:  But it also stands to reason that millions of children might want 
      to taste the power, the bloodthirst, the megalomania that *is* 
      Marrissa Picard, even if only for a short while.  So we thought, why 
      not cash in on it?
 
CROW: Sooooo... welcome to our new theme park: Marrissa-Land!
 
[Mike yelps and leaps backward from the desk.]
 
CROW: Yes, Marrissa-Land, where parents are required to obey their 
      children at all times!
 
TOM:  Park employees will also have to be obedient.  Penalties for 
      failing to follow the orders of a young patron will range from 
      public humiliation to immediate dismissal.
 
MIKE: Hmm ... I suppose workers could also stage fake disputes with each
      other and let the children negotiate binding settlements through 
      food and sleep deprivation and threats of physical violence....
 
CROW: *Now* you're getting into it, Mike!  [Crow points to one corner of
      the desk]  Now over here we've got the obstacle course, where 
      children can drive real cars through hostile territory!
 
TOM:  And over here is the gymnasium, where highly trained martial 
      artists will pretend to allow young patrons to beat them up 
      in cunningly convincing matches!
 
MAGIC VOICE: And all the equipment will be run by computers with voice-
             recognition software, with override access codes given to
             the children.
 
TOM:  Nice touch, Magic Voice.  And here we have the space-battle
      simulators, where kids can rack up their *own* Kobayashi Maru
      times!
 
MIKE: You know, I've always wondered about that.  Where did Ratliff 
      ever get the idea that a psychological test designed to gauge an 
      officer's reaction to a no-win, certain-death situation was
      *really* a battle simulation that measured how long you could
      survive?
 
CROW: Mike, this is Ratliff you're talking about!  Now get with the
      program, you're slowing us down here!
 
MIKE: Well ... you should have a big stage where kids can stand and 
      introduce themselves and brag about all of their achievements,
      listing them over and over, while reporters crowd around asking 
      sycophantic questions.
 
TOM:  Oooh, nice one.
 
[A few bars of pretentious John-Williams-esque music fill the SOL.]
 
TOM:  Right, Cambot!  The park needs Marrissa's theme music blaring from
      all the speakers.
 
CROW: And a theatre where Marrissa stories are staged several times a
      day.
 
[Mike, Tom and Crow all shudder at this thought.  Then Mike picks up one
 of the plastic model buildings for a closer look.]
 
MIKE: What's this at the edge of the park?  "State Penitentiary"? 
      Guys, there's a problem here.  Nobody's going to bring their 
      kids to a park built right next to a high-security prison!
 
TOM:  Mike, relax, it's not a *real* prison!  Tell me, where would
      Marrissa Picard be without an endless supply of evil-but-stupid 
      villains to defeat?
 
MIKE: [thinks for a moment]  Well, I guess she'd be stuck at a 
      no-name boarding school hanging out with her sorority 
      sisters, picking on the less popular girls, and wondering why 
      none of the rich jock guys will date her more than twice.
 
CROW: Exactly!  That's why the prison is there ... to give the Marrissa
      wanna-be's a chance to do battle against amazingly clueless bad
      guys!
 
TOM:  You see, every afternoon the "inmates" --- in reality *highly* 
      paid employees --- will stage a break-out and take over the
      park.  Park employees will be powerless to stop them.  The 
      children will rally together and, using equipment on hand 
      in wacky "Home Alone" fashion, capture all the inmates and send 
      them back to jail!
 
MIKE: Wow.  That *is* clever!  I hope you have good health insurance 
      lined up....
 
CROW: Oh, and all the food served in the park will be strawberry 
      something-or-other.  Strawberry malts....
 
TOM:  Strawberry cheesecake....
 
[Mads light starts flashing.  Mike taps it.]
 
MIKE: Strawberry pancakes....
 
CROW: Strawberry-glazed hamburgers....
 
MIKE & TOM:  Eeewwwwwww!

Dr.F: Oh, but we are!  The potential for evil here is *stunning*!

Ma F: Clayton, get the rolodex out of my briefcase!  We've got some phone

 dialing.  Both are laughing.]

CROW: [as Sisko as Quasimodo]  Sanctuary!  Sanctuary!
 
>>                                               calling the court-martial
>> to order.  On his right sat Doctor Julian Bashir, his left, Lieutenant
>> Sam Lavelle.  At the persecutors table 
 
MIKE: No wonder Ro has a persecution complex!  They renamed the 
      prosecutor's table just for her!

>>                                        sat Lieutenant Commander Worf.
>> The defendant, Ro Laren sat at the defense's table, not in uniform.
 
CROW: [as Sisko]  I will not have tables out of uniform in my courtroom!

>> Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard sat beside her, a smile crossing
>> her face as Sisko asked.  "Mister Worf, would you please read the
>> charges?"
 
TOM:  [as Worf]  Visa or MasterCard?
MIKE: [as Spanish Inquisitor]  You are accused of heresy on *three*
      counts... no, *four* counts... look, I'll come in again.
 
>>         "Ro Laren, Lieutenant, last assignment, CONN Officer, USS

CROW: Ro Laren *is* Mr. B Natural!
 
>>             is charged with sabotaging a mission, five counts of

MIKE: One count of appearing in a crappy fanfic....
 
>>                    and going absent without leave," Worf read.

TOM:  [as Worf]  Oh, and she left the cap off the toothpaste.

>>         "Defense, do you accept the charges?" Sisko asked.
>>         "No, I do not" Marrissa replied.  
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  The prosecution didn't use 1-800-COLLECT!
 
>>                                           Lieutenants Lavelle and
>> Bashir's mouths dropped.  Sisko was taken back as well.  
 
MIKE: You take that Sisko right back!
TOM:  [as Sisko]  Wow, this takes me back to the days of my youth,
      when I watched other fourteen-year old girls do equally stupid
      things....
 
>>                                                          "All the
>> charges after Stardate 47897, are not in the jurisdiction of this
>> court."
>>         "I'm afraid I must disagree, Miss Picard," Sisko responded.
>>         Before Sisko could get in his pronouncement, Marrissa continued,
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  Listen, just because you're in charge of this
      courtroom, don't think that I can't interrupt you whenever I damn
      well please!
 
>> "A Starfleet court-martial can only try someone on events happening
>> while they are in Starfleet.  Ro Laren was not in Starfleet after that
>> STARDATE."
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  You see, Your Honor, Ro Laren is *really* an elf
      who escaped from the slave labor sampo factories on Omicron 
      Theta IX.  This means she is ineligible to be a member of 
      Starfleet, and therefore cannot be tried by this court!
TOM:  [as Gusat]  Makes sense.
 
>>         "Mister Worf, can you counter that?"  Sisko asked.
>>         "I ask for a recess," Worf replied, frustrated.
 
MIKE: [as Worf]  I want to go play on the jungle gym!
 
>>         "One hour recess granted," Sisko responded, hitting the bell.
 
TOM:  And that's the end of Round 1!
 
>> 
>>         An hour later, Sisko reconvened the court.  "Mister Worf, your
>> counter please," he asked.

MIKE: [as Worf]  My counter was too heavy, but I did bring a coffee
      table.

>>         "I regret that I must agree with Lieutenant Commander Picard,"
>> Worf responded.  "Ro Laren's commanding officer at the time, now Rear
>> Admiral Jean-Luc Picard has supported that statement." Then muttering he
>> sat down.  

CROW: [as Worf, muttering] ... senile old fart.

>>           "I suspect Marrissa got to him first."

TOM:  [sarcastically]  Well, if the *great Jean-Luc Picard* feels that
      way about it, then I guess there's just *no possible reason* to
      look into this pivotal issue any further, right?

>>         "What was that Worf?" Doctor Bashir asked.
 
MIKE: What Worf?
TOM:  Where Worf?
CROW: [as Marty Feldman]  There.... There Worf.  There castle....
MIKE: Good one, Crow!
CROW: Thank you, thank you very much.  I'll be here all week.
 
>>         "Nothing Doctor," Worf replied.
 
TOM:  Sure, major violations of ABA Disciplinary Rules, nothing at
      all....
 
>>         "That leaves the charge of abandoning a mission, 
 
MIKE: ... with a little note pinned to its blanket saying, "Kringle."
 
>>                                                          sabotaging it
>> as a result," Captain Sisko stated.  "Mr. Worf, call your witness."
>>         "I call Captain William T. Riker, commanding the starship
>> Enterprise," Worf called.
 
CROW: Even in a text-based fanfic, you can just see ol' Riker swagger
      in after that introduction.
 
>>         "Aren't you lucky that he was vacationing here," Marrissa
>> commented as Riker entered.
 
MIKE: [as Sisko]  Counsel will please keep her snotty comments to herself.
TOM:  I think she means, "Aren't you lucky that I haven't had a chance
      to tamper with *all* the material witnesses yet?"
 
>>         "Luck had nothing to do with it," Riker said as he sat down.
 
CROW: [as Riker]  It was a plot device, plain and simple!
 
>>         Worf began his question, "Captain, on Stardate 47865, you were
>> serving as first officer of the Enterprise NCC-1701-D, where you not?"
 
TOM:  [as Riker]  Uh, Your Honor?  I don't mean to tell you your job
      here, but shouldn't I have been sworn in by now?
 
>>         "Yes, that is the position I held," Captain Riker stated.
 
MIKE: [as Riker]  I also directed a few episodes which received very
      favorable reviews....
 
>>         "Beginning on that STARDATE Ro Laren began a undercover mission
>> to flush out Maquis, correct?" Worf questioned.
>>         "I was so informed," Riker responded.
 
TOM:  [George Bush voice]  I was out of the loop!
 
>>         "Five days later you joined her as her 'brother,' correct?"
>>         "Yes."
>>         "Please tell me what happened during the next couple of days."
 
CROW: [as Riker]  Well, first I woke up, kicked my date for the evening
      out of bed, brushed my teeth....

>>         "The Maquis had been fed information that the Cardassians were
>> trying to construct a biogentic weapon, and that the components of that
>> weapon were on a convoy passing near the DMZ.  Ro had convinced the
>> Maquis that taking the convoy would be a good idea.  
 
MIKE: [falsetto]  It's, like, vital to our survival and stuff.
 
>>                                                      The Enterprise and
>> several other starships were hidden in a nearby nebula.  
 
TOM:  Man, they've got a lot of conveniently placed nebulas in Star Trek!
 
>>                                                          Just before the
>> Maquis raiders were to leave the DMZ, Ro scanned the nebula revealing
>> the Star Fleet vessels.  The Maquis did not leave the zone. She gave me
>> a message for the Captain and beamed off."
>>         "And what was that message."
 
MIKE: [as Riker]  Something about, "Neener neener neener!"
 
>>         "I'm afraid that I don't recall it."
 
TOM:  [as Riker]  My dog ate it.
MIKE: [as Riker]  And I'm afraid that you won't be able to find out
      anything about it by introducing the written report that I gave
      the captain into evidence.
 
>>         "Thank you, Captain," Worf responded.  "Your witness, Marrissa."
 
CROW: [as Sisko]  Yeah, I know it's a court-martial, but we're really
      pretty loose about it.  We're all on a first-name basis and
      everything!
 
>>         "Captain Riker, why did then Captain Picard send you to join
>> Ro?" Marrissa asked, standing up and walking over to Riker.
>>         "He believed that Ro might not be able to complete the mission,"
>> Riker responded.
>>         "So the Captain knew that Ro might not be able to complete the
>> mission, 
 
TOM:  [as Inspector Cluseau]  Zat is vhat I have ben zaying!

>>          yet left her on the mission," Marrissa stated. "Tell me
>> Captain, about how far back in your opinion did this concern go?"
 
CROW: [as Riker]  Back into the very deepest, darkest recesses of my 
      opinion.
TOM:  I'm going about prepositional phrases misplaced for days have
      nightmares to come.
MIKE: [looks at Tom for a few moments, but doesn't say anything]
 
>>         "In my opinion, Captain Picard 
 
CROW: [as Riker] ... is bald.
 
>>                                        did not want her on this mission
>> in the first place," Riker said.
>>         "So Ro was sent on a mission, which her Commanding Officer did
>> not think she could complete, and she did not.
 
TOM:  [as Terry Jones]  Look, are you insinuating something?
CROW: [as Eric Idle]  Oh no, no, nononononononono ... yes!
 
>>                                                  Tell me Captain, why
>> then was she sent on that mission?"
 
MIKE: [as Riker]  The network wanted another "Maquis" episode.  They
      thought they should feed some unfinished storylines into "Deep
      Space Nine," which was just about to premiere, to help boost its
      ratings.
TOM:  [as Sisko]  The court rejects that line of reasoning.
 
>>         "Admiral Carstairs gave the order," Riker remarked.
>>         "Admiral Carstairs, wasn't he the one who as a starship Captain
>> put Ro up before another court-martial."
>>         "Yes."
 
MIKE: Just call her "Marrissa Amber Johnnie Flores Picard Cochrane."
CROW: [Cochrane voice]  With rhyme and "race," I'll win this case!
 
>>         "No further questions," Marrissa said quickly returning to her
>> seat.
>>         "You may step down," Sisko said.  "Lieutenant Commander Picard,
>> you will refrain from making any more insinuations on people not here to
>> defend themselves."
 
TOM:  Attaboy, Sisko!  Come on, slap her with contempt of court!  You
      know you want to!
 
>>         "When did I do that?" Marrissa smiled, innocently.
 
MIKE: [as Sisko]  Computer, play back the defense counsel's last question
      to Captain Riker so that she will know why she is being sent to
      the brig.
 
>>         "You know darn well," Sisko responded.  "Your next witness,
>> Worf."
>>         "The prosecution rests," Worf replied.  
 
TOM:  ... the HELL?!  Worf hasn't even established a prima facie case yet,
      and he rests!  He hasn't even submitted any evidence related to the 
      actual charges at hand!  Marrissa can just rest her case right now, 
      and Ro goes scot free!
CROW: Mike, is this Ratliff portraying Worf as stupid, or Ratliff
      stupidly portraying Worf, or Ratliff just being plain stupid?
MIKE: Too soon to tell.
TOM:  Meanwhile, Sisko seems to have about as much control over his 
      courtroom as Lance Ito....
 
>>                                                    Sisko raised an eyebrow.
>> "Lieutenant Commander Picard, call your first witness please."
>>         "I call Ro Laren," Marrissa stated.  Ro stood up, walked up to
>> the witness chair and sat down.  
 
CROW: Wow, that was even more exciting than the stair-climbing sequences.
 
>>                                  "Ro, Captain Riker stated that my
>> father, Jean-Luc Picard, 
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  ...a relationship about which I am so insecure that
      I keep mentioning it at irrelevant times....
 
>>                           was worried about your ability to complete the
>> mission from the beginning.  How did you feel about the mission."
>>         "Objection," Worf interrupted.  "Feelings are not relevant."
 
MIKE: [as Borg]  This court will be assimilated.
 
>>         "Overruled.  Ro's feelings about this mission are very much a
>> part of this case.  Go ahead."

TOM:  Since when?!  Did this suddenly turn into a psychiatric evaluation
      when I wasn't looking?

>>         Ro drew in a deep breath and began, "Well at first I just
>> thought 
 
TOM:  [as Ro]  ... how nice it was that the writers put me in another
      episode.  I was starting to think they had forgotten about me.
 
>>         it was another mission.  Then after my cover was set, something
>> familiar hit.  The role I was acting was like 
 
TOM:  [as Ro]  ... in those soap operas when they intend to write a
      character out of the series altogether!
 
>>                                               the time I spent in the
>> Bajoran Resistance.  I began to feel like a Cardassian plant.
 
CROW: Leafy, green and photosynthetic.
 
>> Eventually I got over it.  
 
MIKE: [as Ro]  My feelings are pretty shallow that way.
TOM:  [as John Cleese]  I got better....
 
>>                             But as I got to know the people, the feeling
>> returned.  When the Cardassians attacked the town where I was living, I
>> defended myself.
 
CROW: [as Ro]  Not the town, mind you, just myself.
 
>>                   In the fire fight, the leader of the cell, who I had
>> grown close to died.  Suddenly everything had changed.  I wasn't a Star
>> Fleet Officer looking at people who were disobeying the law.  
 
TOM:  [falsetto]  I was Celestria, Queen of the Galaxy!
 
>>                                                              I was one
>> of them.  I had felt and shared their loss.  
 
TOM:  [as Clinton]  I feel your pain.
 
>>                                              I was apart of them.  I
>> also discovered that I was his chosen successor.  I did not want to let
>> them down, but I also didn't want to let Captain Picard down."
>>         "That's when then Commander Riker joined you," Marrissa
>> prompted.
>>         "Yes, I have to admit I was resentful of the Commander being
>> added.  It was as if Captain Picard didn't trust me.  
 
ALL:  ... because he *didn't*!
 
>>                                                        On top of that,
>> the plan to capture the Maquis who had become my friends had me
>> doubting my loyalties as well."
>>         "What made you decide to resign and protect your new friends?"
 
TOM:  [as Number Two]  Number Six, why did you resign?!
 
>>         "I think it was that friendship ... During the time I was in
>> Star Fleet, I never developed many friends.  
 
CROW: [as Ro]  They always used to laugh and call me names.  They never
      let me join in any Starfleet games.
 
>>                                              When I served under
>> Captain Carstairs on the Challenger, I was on the fast track, 
 
MIKE: [as Ro]  All those medals and promotions were a real hardship.
 
>>                                                               and not
>> many people were willing to associate with a Bajoran.  
 
CROW: They bring down the property values, you know.
TOM:  Yup.
 
>>                                                        At the time our
>> home world was still occupied by the Cardassians and we were seen as
>> little more than stray dogs.   
 
MIKE: Bad Bajoran!  Go home!
 
>>                            Then I was court-martialed for disobeying
 
CROW: ... the leash laws.  I tell you, that was the last straw!
 
>> orders that I couldn't obey in good conscience.  When I was assigned to

>> still didn't get many friends, with the exception of Guinan, hostess in
>> Ten-Forward.  
 
TOM:  ... and several of her hats.
 
>>               I never felt like I belonged.

MIKE: [as Morrissey]  Did I mention that I cried?

>>                                              The Maquis, after I passed
>> though there initial suspicions, made me feel like I belonged."
 
CROW: [announcer voice]  We've secretly replaced this Starfleet
      court-martial with the plot line from "I Accuse My Parents."
      Will these Starfleet officers be able to tell the difference?
      Let's watch....
 
>>         "One last question," Marrissa asked.  "Knowing what you know
>> now, would you have taken that mission?"
>>         "No, 
 
MIKE: [as Ro]  When they wrote me out of the series, they told me I
      could have a recurring role on the new DS9 series, but that never 
      happened.
 
>>              I didn't have the loyalty and ties to Star Fleet that it
>> takes to go undercover," Ro replied.  "I didn't know that then, but I do
>> now."
 
TOM:  [as Ro]  I couldn't *handle* the truth!
 
>>         "Your witness, Worf," Marrissa concluded.
>>         "You stated that you were beginning to doubt yourself way before
>> you resigned," Worf recapped.  "Why didn't you ask to be pulled off the
>> mission?"
 
MIKE: ... because the episode would have under-run?
TOM:  [as Worf]  Sorry, Your Honor.  I meant to ask something relevant,
      like:  "Did you or did you not desert Starfleet and give your
      services over to an enemy agency?"
 
>>         "I felt that I could push myself though the doubts," Ro
>> responded.  "And I didn't want to let Captain Picard down."
>>         "An honorable intention," Worf replied.  "But you still let him
>> down.  You disobeyed orders, abandoned your post, betrayed your fellow
>> officers..."
 
TOM:  [as Worf]  But since you explained how you felt about it, I guess
      we can drop the charges.  Just don't let it happen again!
 
>>         "Objection, badgering the witness," Marrissa interrupted.
>>         "Sustained," Sisko rang.  "The prosecution will refrain from
>> resighting a list of the offenses the defendant is on trail for."
 
MIKE: Well, sure, I can see how talking about the crimes Ro is accused
      of committing would be totally irrelevant --- huh?
TOM:  I'm continually amazed how many ways Ratliff can misspell even 
      *with* a working spellchecker.
CROW: Not to mention Eugen Woiwod, who should probably keep his day job.
 
>>         "No further questions," Worf concluded.  A shaken Ro descended
>> from the stand.
 
TOM:  My God, Pauly Shore would make a better prosecutor than Worf!

>>         "The Defense would like to enter into the record, the
>> defendant's last Commanding Officer's recommendations and comments,"
>> Marrissa asked.
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  See?  My dad says it's okay, so you *have* to let
      her go!
 
>>         "Does the Prosecution have any objections?" Sisko asked.

MIKE: [as Sisko]  Oops, I meant to say *Persecution* there....

>>         "No, your honor," Worf replied.
>>         "So entered," Sisko stated.
>>         "The Defense rests," Marrissa stated.
>>         "Then we will call it a day," Sisko responded.  
 
CROW: That day lasted 20 minutes, tops.
MIKE: Starfleet sure overworks its officers.  
TOM:  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, after an *exhaustive* investigation
      into *all* the relevant issues, the court stands adjourned.  Sad,
      really.
 
>>                                                         "Tomorrow we
>> will hear your closing statements."
 
MIKE: ... right after these commercial messages.

TOM:  Those looking for plausibility and gripping dialogue need not apply.
 
>> 
>> Chapter Ten
>> 
>>         Jay Gordon was admiring Marrissa's Quarters.  He liked
>> Marrissa's taste.  
 
MIKE: I'll bet she tastes like strawberries.
TOM:  Eeewwwwwwww!
CROW: Mike, that was wrong!
MIKE: I know.  I'm so ashamed.
 
>>                    The soft green drapes hugged the windows, benefiting
>> from the saucer design of the remodeled ship.  Jay noticed the painting
>> of  Marrissa, himself, Clara, Alexander, and Shayna coming out of the
>> woods of DOAllen.  
 
TOM:  Their friends had left them there days ago after playing the
      cruel tripe-hunting prank.
 
>>                    "Data's work?" he inquired.
>>         "Yes, he gave it to me as a gift when I left the Enterprise,"
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  He said I could have it as long as I promised never
      to come back.
 
>> Marrissa confirmed offering Jay his favorite drink, root beer.
 
MIKE: Candy is dandy, but liquor is off-limits to Ratliff's command
      staff.
 
>>         "I don't think he got Shayna's hair right," Jay remarked,
>> accepting the drink.
>>         "I'll tell him," Marrissa responded.
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  And then I'll have him killed.
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Anything for another chance to humiliate a
      superior officer....
 
>>         "He'll undoubtedly endeavor to be more observant," Jay smiled.
>> "So how is your case going?"
>>         "I'm not sure," Marrissa replied.  
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  I'll win, of course, but I've had remarkably few
      chances so far to recite my list of titles and accomplishments or
      my Kobayashi Maru time.

>>                                            "The charge reduction idea
>> worked, 
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  Smaller Visa bills really *do* reduce my interest
      payments.
 
>>         but like you said, that was a fairly easy maneuver.  Riker's
>> testimony went well, but I'm afraid that there are too many holes in the
 
ALL:  Plot!
 
>> favorable part of his testimony.  I hope Worf missed them."
>>         "Considering some of the things Worf missed in the past, you
>> have nothing to fear," Jay encouraged.
 
MIKE: [as Worf]  I *heard* that.
CROW: [as Jay]  Eeeeep!
 
>>         "You may be right," Marrissa said, not quite sure.  
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  If not, I can always beat Worf up again, like I did
      when I was 12....
 
>>                                                             "But I still
>> have to get through the closing statements."
>>         "You will, Risa," Jay responded, trying to get a reaction.
>>         "Jay Alan Gordon," Marrissa suddenly perked up, 
 
CROW: I think Ratliff is confusing perkiness with psychotic mania.
 
>>                                                         "How many times
>> do I have to tell you not to call me that?"
 
TOM:  [as Jay, excited]  Oh yes, Marrissa.  I'm being *very* bad.  I
      think you're going to have to punish me.
 
>>         "Oh, some number around infinity," Jay smiled.  "So are you
>> willing to hear my suggestions, your highness."
>>         "Yes, but drop the titles, sir knight," Marrissa replied,
>> somewhat peeved 
 
CROW: I think Ratliff is confusing peevishness with....
MIKE: We *know*.
 
>>                 after Jay's jabs.  "Or I'll spend some time giving your
>> little sister some new ways to drive you nuts."
 
TOM:  Chinese water torture, long-term solitary confinement, forced
      reading of all the Stephen Ratliff stories in one sitting....
 
>>         "Please, not Jacquelynn."
 
MIKE: The Day of the Jacquelynn.

>>         Once again, the court-martial assembled in Deep Space Nine's
>> Observation Lounge.  
 
CROW: ... or observed in DS9's Assembled Lounge.
MIKE: I think you've done that joke enough now, Crow!
 
>>                       Commander Sisko rang the bell, calling the court to
>>  order.
 
CROW: [as doorman from Wizard of Oz]  Who rang that bell?!
 
>>          "Commander Worf, your closing statement please."
 
TOM:  [as Worf]  She's guilty.  I'm finished.
 
>> 
>>         "Lieutenant Ro Laren is charged with disobeying orders,
>> sabotaging a mission, and defecting," Worf said, beginning to pace in
>> front of the judges.  
 
CROW: [as Worf, muttering]  I don't know if I can hold it until recess; 
      I really gotta go....
 
>>                       "She deliberately did so, with full knowledge of
>> the consequences of her actions.  She has shown a remarkable willingness
>> to 
 
MIKE: ... sulk moodily in strange body postures.
 
>>    explain her actions, but that does not change the fact that she did
>> the deeds.  Ro Laren has shown disregard for orders in the past, which
>> is a matter of her record.  She does not protest the events which lead
>> to this trial.  As such she should be found guilty."
 
TOM:  [as Worf]  Granted, I haven't given you one shred of evidence to
      *prove* that she did these things, but take my word for it, OK?
      I gotta get outta here on the last shuttle, so let's hurry this up.  
      Riker and I have a movie to shoot.
 
>>         "Miss Picard, your closing," Sisko prompted after Worf sat down.
 
MIKE: Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Henson's Perry Mason Babies.
 
>> 
>>         "Thank you Captain," Marrissa responded, standing up to address
>> the judges.  
>>              "It's an interesting situation we have here.

MIKE: In *this* story?  You're kidding, right?

>>                                                            Star Fleet
>> Command wanted Ro to be tried for the events which lead to her
>> resignation.  Meanwhile outside these doors, reporters await our
>> results, questioning what effect this will have on Maquis Independence.

CROW: [as Marrissa]  Just my usual entourage of 60 or 70 reporters. 
      Pay them no mind.
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  We *should* be letting the *media* try this case!
 
>> 
>>         "In any case, you must judge Ro.  It can not be an easy task.
>> Star Fleet has always held that if you can't carry out your duties, in
>> good conscience, you should resign.  Ro tried to carry out her duties,
>> and resigned when she could not do so in good conscience.

TOM:  Show me the regulation that says that pointing a phaser at a 
      superior officer and beaming away is a valid way to "resign."
CROW: [as Ro]  I resign.  Now don't make me shoot you!

>>                                                      Ro is now
>> being tried for doing what her conscience told her, which is an ideal
>> which Star Fleet holds dear.
 
MIKE: So if your conscience tells you to commit a crime, it's okay.  "Star
      Trek" suddenly makes a lot more sense now!
 
>>                               In any case, the facts of the case are as
>> Worf stated them.  Ro did commit those deeds.
>>         "The question is 
 
TOM:  Why is a courtroom scene with less drama than a quilting bee
      the entire second half of this story?
MIKE: Well, they did the same thing on TNG more than once.
CROW: On TOS, they knew how to end these courtroom episodes with a
      decent fist fight *and* the ship in peril....
 
>>                           not if, or even why she did so.  She did, and
>> we have heard her reasons, which undoubtedly were the result of much
>> soul searching 
 
CROW: [as announcer]  Tonight on "Soul Search" --- a friendless Bajoran
      Star Fleet lieutenant sings selections from Tina Turner's latest
      album!
TOM:  That soul searching and those reasons *might* be worth one or two
      years off of her sentence, but I doubt it.
 
>>                on her part.  No, the question is, is this the right place
>> to try her.

MIKE: Then hand her over to the *Federation's* criminal justice system!
      I'm sure they'd *LOVE* to have a shot at putting her away for good.

>>             She was not a member of Star Fleet at the time.
 
TOM:  Sorry, Ratliff.  Repeating this idea won't make it any more
      believable!
 
>>                                                               She
>> submitted her resignation, due to orders she could not obey in good
>> conscience.  This is in the tradition of Star Fleet.  Other officers
>> have done so in the past, they were not tried by Star Fleet.
 
TOM:  Ah yes ... the grand old Starfleet tradition of pointing a phaser
      at a superior officer and beaming to an enemy ship!  How could you
      *possibly* punish Ro for that?
 
>>                                                               In fact

MIKE: Well, here's our little fugitive!  Welcome back!  We've got a nice 
      little cell all ready for you!
 
>>         "Gentlemen, remember that tradition while you deliberate,"

MIKE: [as Sisko]  We need about five minutes for a cup of tea. Dr. Bashir, 
      is the hanging rope ready?
 
>> 
>>         "Glinn, do you know how to play poker?"  
 
CROW: [as Gusat]  Poke who?
 
>>                                                  It was an innocent

>> The two had been eating lunch in the ship's mess on deck six 

CROW: It's not *my* mess.  You clean it up!
MIKE: Old joke.

>>                                                               above seven

TOM:  ... of junior Khan Noonian Singhs....

>>                                                             were playing
>> last night," Gusat asked.  Duvek nodded.  "I've watched them play a
>> couple of times, and I know the rules, what's good to hold and what's
>> bad, but I've never played it."
 
CROW: [as Gusat]  But I still don't understand why they were removing
      clothing as they played.
 
>>         "Some of us would like to learn the game well enough to
>>  challenge the Commander's circle," Duvek replied.
>>         "A worthy ambition, if not difficult," Gusat commented.  "Just
>> who is 'some of us.'"
>>         "Myself, Assist Guvek, Assist Dar Ekat, and Dar Dukat," Duvek
>> informed.
 
CROW: Better wipe off the screen after that sentence.
[Mike stands up and squeegees the screen.]

>>         "Good," Gusat replied.
>>         "You expected a problem?" Duvek asked, judging Gusat's tone from
>> his long friendship.
>>         "Frankly, yes," Gusat responded.  "If you had mentioned Assist
>> Dar Davek, I would have suspected an ulterior motive."
 
MIKE: [as Gusat]  He's the one who kills people when he loses at cards, 
      right?
 
>>         "You mean the noble Orange Wing Commander who got in a fight
>> with a Star Fleet Engineer last night 
 
TOM: HiKeevek!
 
>>                                       and is residing in Guvek's brig,"
>> Duvek remarked.  "You will have Gavek's recommendation, along with
>> Commander Picard's, on your desk after lunch.  It seems that he isn't
>> doing any better as a wing commander than he is at integrating himself
>> into a mixed crew."  
 
CROW: I'm having trouble keeping track of names here.  I can't tell who's
      a new character and who's just misspelled!
 
>>         "So I can expect a rather poor recommendation on Davek?" Gusat
>> inquired.
 
MIKE: [as Duvek]  You mean the kind of recommendation that puts a huge
      black spot on a Cardassian officer's career and follows him around
      for the rest of his life?
TOM:  Huh?
MIKE: Just following along with the pattern....
 
>>         "Scathing might be more like it," Duvek responded.
 
CROW: And what the heck does this have to do with *anything* else in
      the story?
 
>>                                                             Then as

>>         "Has he found the spell check function yet?" Gusat asked.
>>         "I think so, and the thesaurus as well," Duvek replied.
 
CROW: [as Duvek]  But despite all that, he *still* writes like Ratliff!
MIKE: I get the feeling that Ratliff set that situation up *just* so we
      could knock it down, don't you?
TOM:  Yeah.  Strange.

>> Chapter Eleven
>> 
>>         The court room was silent as Captain Benjamin Sisko, 
 
TOM:  ... began his rendition of "My Way."
 
>>                                                              Doctor
>> Julian Bashir, and Lieutenant Samuel Lavelle filed in the room.
 
MIKE: After that, there was some data entry and dictation to be done.
 
>> Lieutenant Commander Worf sat, confident that he 
 
CROW: ... physically resembled Perry Mason more than Marrissa did.
 
>>                                                  had made his case,
>> behind his table.  Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard sat at the
>> defendant's table, not at all confident, in fact she was going through
>> all the flaws in her conduct of the case, real and imagined in her mind.
 
TOM:  And boy does she have a *big* list of them to choose from!
MIKE: If only the author would follow Marrissa's example here....
 
>> Meanwhile the defendant sat passive, accepting her fate, what ever it
>> might be.
 
CROW: Sounds like a Bajoran resistance fighter to me, all right.
TOM:  Yup.
 
>>         "We find the defendant not guilty," Captain Benjamin Sisko
>> pronounced, to the astonishment of both counsels.  
 
CROW: ... and absolutely *none* of the readers.
[MIKE stands up and throws various heavy objects at the screen]
MIKE: [screaming]  Court martial Ben Sisko!  No justice, no peace!!!
CROW: Uh, Mike?  Are you okay?
MIKE: Huh?  Oh yeah, I'm fine.  I was just starting a riot.
CROW: What?
MIKE: You know ... inciting to violence, promoting anarchy.  It's a
      little tradition we have down on Earth in America whenever a
      court verdict just screams "gross miscarriage of justice."
TOM:  Mike, if I remember that tradition right, you can't participate in
      it unless you're a minority and poor.  Did you see any riots in
      Beverly Hills after the O.J. verdict came out?
MIKE: [pauses]  Yeah, I guess you're right....
[MIKE sits down]
 
>>                                                     Worf barely
>> restrained himself from using a Klingon cuss word.
 
TOM:  A loose translation of the word would be: "May Stephen Ratliff be
      commissioned to rewrite your nation's historical documents."
 
>>                                                      Marrissa was over
>> joyed at her success, in fact she was at a loss of words.
 
CROW: If only *that* moment could last....
 
>>                                                             "We believe
>> that her actions were guided by her conscience, which as Commander
>> Picard has pointed out is the best that Star Fleet expects.
 
MIKE: [as Sisko]  Go in peace and continue your life of crime and
      terrorism against the Federation, Ro.  You have our blessing!
TOM:  [as Ro]  Great!  And now, if you'll excuse me, my conscience
      tells me that for the good of the Maquis, this space station
      must be blown up.
 
>> Furthermore, we find that the mission she was sent on was ill
>> advised and should have been stopped before it started.  As such we
>> believe that an acquittal is the only course we could have arrived at.
>> Court is adjourned"
 
TOM:  Wait!  What about handing her over to civilian authorities to try
      her for smuggling and piracy and stuff!  OK, so we know from prior 
      experience that the Federation is hopelessly screwed up about a lot
      of things.  But I'm reasonably confident that stealing starships, 
      gassing people, and blowing stuff up are *probably* still 
      considered crimes!

>> 
>>         Marrissa Picard and Ro Laren exited the courtroom together,
>> heading to the Promenade.  
 
CROW: Or promenading to the....  You were right, Mike.  I should have
      quit after the last one.
 
>>                            The judgment of the court was just being
>> realized by Ro.
 
[ALL imitate sounds of reporters rushing to the scene.]
MIKE: [as reporter]  Ms. Picard, is there any truth to the allegation
      that the court-martial verdict was influenced by "Ratliff gas"?
CROW: [as reporter]  Were the judges locked in a room and threatened
      with violence until they came to a verdict that you approved of?
TOM:  [as reporter]  Ms. Ro Laren, now that you've won your case, what
      crimes of conscience do you plan in the future?
 
>>                  "Commander, I believe I owe you dinner," Ro remarked.
>>         "That's not necessary, Ro," Marrissa responded.   "I was just
>> doing my job
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  ... and now I must move on, to free other traitors!
 
>>               and most of my plans came from Jay anyway."
>>         "Commander, plans can go wrong very quickly if you don't know
>> how to execute them and can't make up for holes in them," Ro replied.
 
TOM:  Which you didn't, of course.  But that didn't matter, since you'd
      bought off the judge and prosecutor....
 
>> "Which you knew how to, so I do owe you."
>>         From behind them, Odo's voice came, "One minute if you will,
>> Miss Ro."
 
MIKE: [as Columbo]  ... Just one more thing....
 
>>         "Certainly Constable," Ro responded.  "What can I do for you?"
>>         "Get off my station as soon as possible," Odo remarked gruffly.
 
TOM:  [as Odo]  No wait, that came out all wrong....  Ro, come with me
      to the brig where you will await trial on charges from the
      Federation civilian authorities...
 
>>         "I'll be booking a passage to Bajor after dinner, Constable," Ro
>> responded.  "You really should improve your menu in the brig.  Its
>> almost cruel and unusual punishment."
 
MIKE: At least they don't make you read any Ratliff stories there.
 
>>         "Talk to Quark, he has the contract," Odo said, 
 
CROW: [as Odo]  You may beat him senseless if you want.
 
>>                                                          turning around
>> to leave.
>>         "What are you planning to do on Bajor?" Marrissa asked.
 
CROW: [as Ro]  I'M GOING TO DISNEYLAND!!!
 
>>         "There is an old opponent of mine who is rather high in the
>> religious orders," Ro responded.  "I though I'd stop by and annoy her."
 
TOM:  [as Ro]  Who knows?  Maybe I could hijack one of *her* ships!
MIKE: I just realized something.  The only extracurricular hobby
      Ratliff characters ever have is hanging around and annoying each
      other!
CROW: Well, that's pretty much Ratliff's only hobby, too....
 
>> Behind them a thump was heard.  Ro and Marrissa wheeled around.  Odo was
>> lying on the floor, unconscience.
 
MIKE: Sorry, I just don't buy it.  Odo is one of the most "conscienced"
      people in the Star Trek universe.
 
>>         "What in the world?" Marrissa exclaimed.  Then she too was
>> knocked out.
 
ALL:  WAHOOOO!!!!!!!
TOM:  Now's your chance, whoever you are!  One shot with a phaser set to
      kill, that's all I'm asking!  You've already assaulted a peace
      officer.  What have you got to lose?
 
>>         Ro turned to the attacker and inquired, "Why did you do that?
>> I've been acquitted."
>>         "Sorry sir," the gruff Maquis responded.
 
CROW: [as gruff Maquis]  Duh, you wants I should stop hitting them now?
 
>>         "Oh well, I assume an escape has been arranged?" Ro asked.
>>         "This way."
 
MIKE: So let me get this straight....  Ratliff wasted major portions of
      three chapters trying to set Ro free in the most ridiculous way 
      possible, when all along a much more believable way to achieve this
      goal had been thought of and planned for?
TOM:  Yup.  Pretty much.
 
>> 
>>         A hour later, Marrissa woke up in the infirmary with a headache.
>> "What happened?" she asked, her hand going to her head.
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  Funny, I don't remember that dent being there
      before....  By the way, who am I?
 
>>         "Someone tried to use your head as an anvil," Doctor Bashir
>> responded.
 
CROW: [hopefully]  They placed a red-hot piece of metal on it and
      bashed it repeatedly with a 20-pound hammer?
MIKE: [as Bashir]  It looked like fun.  I'd like to try it myself, if
      I may.
 
>>         "Remind me to tell Odo that I'm not happy with his security,"
>> Marrissa remarked, sitting up.
 
TOM:  [regal falsetto]  We are displeased.
 
>>         "I'm not happy with it either," Odo responded from a nearby bed.
>> "Doctor, can I leave now?"
>>         "You both may go, but try not to get hurt again," Doctor Bashir
>> responded.
>>         "Doctor, I'm in the Command Branch," Marrissa responded.  
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  Have I told you the stories of all my honors and 
      accomplishments and titles and stuff?  And I'm a princess!
 
>>                                                                   "We're
>> supposed to get hurt.
 
MIKE: I've been following your life story for some time now, Marrissa,
      and it occurs to me that you've got some catching up to do in the 
      "getting hurt" part of life.  I'd like to rectify that situation
      if I ever get the chance....
TOM:  I'd settle for just hurting the author.
 
>>                        That way we can disregard the Doctor's orders and
>> pull off some feat while the CMO is trying to get us to return to
>> Sickbay."
 
CROW: Tell that to the Szustakowski kids.
 
>>         "That explains a lot," Doctor Bashir stated.  
 
TOM:  It explains that the Star Trek writers use the same lame plot
      device to build suspense over and over and over.
 
>>                                                       "Oh, Lieutenant
>> Jay Gordon was here.  He said that he would like to see you as soon as
>> you can."
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  Tell him not tonight.  I have a headache.

TOM:  Star Trek --- The Quinn-Martin Generation.
 
>> 
>>         "So Jay, what's up?"  Marrissa asked, as they finished their
>> dinner on the station's Promenade's Replimat.
 
TOM:  [as Jay]  Well, in space that's a little harder to define because
      the normal frames of reference don't exist, so....
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Shut up, Jay.
 
>>         "Let's see, we've lost three of the four Intrepids in the DMZ,
>> two of Deep Space Nine's three runabouts, and several other merchant
>> ships are now Maquis," Jay recited.
 
TOM:  [singing, a la "The 12 Days of Christmas"]  Three of four
      Intrepids,
CROW: [singing]  Two of three runabouts,
MIKE: [singing]  One Deep Space Nine,
ALL:  [singing]  And the merchant ships are now Maaaaaquiiiiiiiiiis!

>>         "Has Congress or Star Fleet decided what to do

MIKE: [as Jay]  Starfleet has decided to let them go.  If they come
      back, they're ours.  If not, they never were.
 
>>                                                         about the Maquis
>> Declaration of Independence?" Marrissa asked.  "I've been too busy with
>> Ro's trail to keep up."
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Following footprints and broken twigs is hard work,
      you know!
MIKE: [as Jay]  Well, there was a massive seismic disturbance on Earth
      caused by Thomas Jefferson spinning in his grave, but other than 
      that....

>>         "Congress is still debating," Jay responded.  "Star Fleet has
>> altered our patrol routes to the outside of the DMZ.  
 
TOM:  Why was Starfleet sending military vessels on patrol *inside* a 
      "demilitarized zone" in the first place!?
MIKE: I still say, Ratliff doesn't know what that phrase means.
 
>>                                                       Cardassian Central
>> Command is doing likewise."
>>         "Sensible, but I'm sure you didn't invite me to dinner to
>> discuss politics," Marrissa stated.
 
CROW: [as Jay]  You got me.  Actually I wanted to discuss logical
      positivism.
 
>>         "No, to be honest, it's boring on the Independence," Jay
>> remarked.  "As Chief of Operations, I'm now senior staff and their
>> aren't very many people who aren't nervous around me.  
 
MIKE: [as Jay]  And since I'm the favorite protege of Marrissa Picard, 
      there's no one who doesn't fear and loathe me.

>>                                                         And those that
>> aren't won't associate with me due to my age."
 
TOM:  Yeah, sure, kid, whatever you say.  But before jumping to 
      conclusions, I'd check out the pictures of "boring" and
      "insufferable" in the dictionary....
 
>>         "I know the feeling," Marrissa consoled.
 
MIKE: [as snooty supermodel]  Don't hate me because I'm power-crazed, 
      psychotic, and superior to you in every way....
 
>>                                                   "At least you're a
>> little older than I was when I became Chief of Security on the
>> Enterprise."
>>         "You at least had the support of your kid's crew and some good
>> friends," Jay maintained.  "My first officer hasn't said any more than
>> 'yes sir, no sir' since I got promoted."
 
TOM:  Wait a minute.  Didn't he say earlier that his *dad* was the 
      ship's first officer?
MIKE: Tom, if I could clearly remember little details like that from a
      story like this, I think I'd go crazy.
TOM:  Electronic memory is a mixed blessing at best, Mike.
CROW: Hey, maybe he means the officer assigned directly under him.
MIKE: Well, I'm going out on a limb here, but *maybe* that officer was 
      resentful that a 15-year-old brat was promoted into a position which
      he, by training and experience, should have been assigned?

>>         "You do have a problem," Marrissa observed.  "Well you know
>> where Clara and I are, if you 
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  ... need someone killed.
 
>>                                feel the need to talk to some one.
>> Meanwhile, I can get used to a handsome young man taking me out to dinner
>> when we're both in port."  
 
CROW: [as Marrissa]  Do you know any?

>>                            Jay blushed.

TOM:  Mike, does this sound even remotely like the way human teenagers
      talk to each other when they like each other?
MIKE: Not that I recall.
TOM:  I didn't think so.
 
>>                                          "By the way, you said you were
>> going to the Academy in six months.  How?  After all you have to be 16
>> to be a Cadet."
 
TOM:  Oh, now that's sensible thinking!  You have to be 16 to attend 
      the Academy, but it's perfectly OK to be Grand Admiral and Empress
      of Starfleet at 12!
MIKE: Give it a rest, Tom.
 
>>         "Technically, Clara, Alex, and I won't be Cadets," Jay
>> responded.  "We are 
 
CROW: [as Jay] ... Superior Beings gracing the Academy with our presence.
 
>>                     officers going back for additional training."
>>         "When did Alex get his Ensign's rank?" Marrissa asked.
>>         "You didn't hear?" Jay remarked.  "Star Fleet Diplomatic gave
>> him it after he stepped in at Higanus XXII."
 
CROW: [as Alexander]  <Squish!>  Eww!  Was that Higanus XXII I just
      stepped in?
 
>>         "The Klingon planet in Federation space that had a brief civil
>> war?" Marrissa asked.
 
MIKE: [as Jay]  When Klingons argue over "tastes great/less filling," 
      they don't kid around.
 
>>         "Yeah, the Federation sent a mediator with Worf as an advisor,"
>> Jay confirmed.  "Alex came along with his father.  After a bomb killed
>> the mediator and injured Worf he took over and got them to stop."
 
MIKE: [as Jay]: Luckily, Worf had brought along some pain sticks that
      proved invaluable to the negotiation process....
TOM:  Is someone keeping track of all these plot devices?  They're all 
      starting to blur together....
 
>>         "This has to be ironic," Marrissa remarked.  "The kid from a
>> warrior race gets his rank by ending a war, while us humans get it by
>> going into battle."
>>         "Hey, you knew he wasn't going to get it the way we did," Jay
>> responded.
 
TOM:  [as Jay]  I always thought he'd "get it" by being shot in the back
      by his own crew.
 
>>            "After all we all got tired of hearing that 'I don't want to
>> be a warrior' refrain."
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  Hmph.  Such a worthless little creature.  Doesn't
      he realize that killing is FUN?
CROW: [as Jay, mockingly]  I don't wanna be a warrior!  I don't wanna
      taste my own blood!  I don't wanna die in the mud on some alien
      planet!  Geez, what a baby....
 
>>         "True, and he doesn't have the Engineering talent to follow
>> Clara," Marrissa remarked.  "Did you hear that Shayna just got her
>> rank?"
 
TOM:  Hey, Ratliff!  Did you hear that nobody besides you *cares*?
CROW: It's less boring than an introduction sequence, but not by much....

>>         "How did she manage that?" Jay asked.  "She was the one I
>> thought was going to have to go through the Academy."
 
TOM:  Don't try to lie to us like that, Stephen.
MIKE: Ah yes, the low point in any Kid's Crew member's career --- being
      forced to go through ... THE ACADEMY!!!  The *horror*!
 
>>         "Sorry, you lost that bet.  She followed Clara's footsteps,"
>> Marrissa responded.  "She seems to be specializing in weaponry and
>> shields.  
 
MIKE: [as Marrissa]  And genocidal devices.  It was my idea.
 
>>           Her latest is in this month Daystrom Journal.  'Mechanics of
>> Shield Regeneration: A New Approach.'  I don't understand a word of it."
 
TOM:  [as Marrissa]  So it must not be important.
 
>>         "I told you that Clara and Shayna spend too much time together,"
>> Jay replied.
 
CROW: [as Jay]  Admit I'm right!  Admit I'm right!!!
 
>> 
>> Here ends Premier Maquis.
 
TOM:  Here rejoices Tom Servo.
MIKE: Here relaxes Mike Nelson.
CROW: Here vomits Crow T. Robot.

[SOL control room]
 
[Gypsy is wearing a judge's wig.  Crow is wearing a striped prisoner's 
 hat.  Servo has eyeglasses on his dome and a small briefcase glued to 
 one hand.]
 
MIKE: The court of the Satellite of Love is now in session.  The case
      before the court is the Sentient Beings of the Satellite versus
      Crow T. Robot.  The honorable judge Gypsy presiding.  All rise.
 
GYPSY: [regally]  You may be seated.  Bailiff, read the charges.
 
MIKE: [reading from paper]  The defendant, the extremely naughty Crow
      T. Robot...
 
CROW: Objection!
 
MIKE: ... is accused of not doing his chores yesterday, to wit, not 
      cleaning out the load pan bay like he was *clearly* ordered to 
      do.  [Mike glares at Crow, then steps off camera.]
 
GYPSY: Prosecution, state your case.
 
TOM:  [F. Lee Bailey voice]  Thank you, your honor.  May it please the 
      court, the case before the court today is an extremely typical 
      one....
 
CROW: Hey!
 
TOM:  The facts of this case are not in dispute.  The defendant, a 
      resident of this Satellite, did not clean out the load pan bay
      yesterday.  
 
      Your honor, this task which society has imposed upon the defendant 
      is a fairly simple one which takes very little time (especially 
      for someone with working arms), and contributes greatly to the 
      safety and welfare of society and its members.  In return, the 
      defendant receives shelter from the elements, his own room, a 
      steady supply of RAM chips and comic books...

CROW: Objection!  Graphic novels!

GYPSY: Sustained.

TOM:  *ahem* ...and nearly unlimited access to the internet and satellite 
      TV.  This arrangement of society provides a sound basis for law which 
      is accepted by sentient beings throughout the galaxy, except for some 
      of the looniest of the Objectivists.
 
      Moreover, this task was originally imposed upon the defendant 
      by his Creator, a fact which provides a basis for law universally 
      recognized by all major religions.  We therefore ask this court to 
      find the defendant guilty as charged.  The prosecution rests.
 
GYPSY: Thank you.  Defense, state your case.
 
CROW: *ahem* ... I didn't feel like doing it.
 
GYPSY: I hereby rule in favor of the defendant.  Case dismissed and 
       court adjourned.
 
TOM:  [extremely agitated]  WHAT!?!!?  You've gotta be kidding!  This was 
      an open and shut case!  The defendant is obviously incredibly 
      guilty!  It's a travesty of justice!  You want the truth?  This
      whole COURTROOM is out of order!!!  If it doesn't fit, don't 
      acquit!!  Give a hoot!  Don't pollute!!!

GYPSY: Sorry, Tom, I'm just reading what it says in the script.

CROW: Ha ha ha, I told those coppers they didn't have nothin' on me!
      See ya around, counselor!

["Dragnet" closing music starts.  Crow moves to center stage, Tom and 
 Gypsy move off camera.  Mike hangs a cardboard sign with numbers on it 
 around Crow's neck.  Spotlight on Crow.]
 
MAGIC VOICE: The story you have just heard is true.  The names have 
             not been changed because there wouldn't be any point.
             Although the defendant was found not guilty, he resolved to 
             live a better life and always do his chores on time from 
             now on.
 
CROW: WHAT?!
 
MAGIC VOICE: Sorry, Crow.  That's what Mike's script says.

CROW: Hey!  That wasn't in my script!  I never agreed to this!
      Get my agent on the phone!
 
[Final bars of "Dragnet" theme.  Normal lighting returns.  Everyone 
 moves back on camera and acts more relaxed, though clearly showing the 
 strain of surviving the fanfic.  Mike removes the sign from Crow, the 
 glasses from Servo, and the wig from Gypsy.]
 
MIKE: Well guys, we got through another Ratliff.  What is this, eleven 
      now?
 
TOM:  You know, over the last few years, we've read a lot of fanfics, 
      and we've seen a lot of authors who technically write as bad, 
      or worse, than Ratliff.
 
CROW: Yeah, but today's experiment has taught us once again that 
      nothing, but *nothing*, can convey a deeply fundamental 
      sense of Absolute Wrongness, or cause lasting psychological trauma, 
      like a Ratliff ... except maybe "Night of the Next Generation."
 
MIKE: That's true.  Still, there was one redeeming point in today's 
      story.  One small gleam of sunlight in an otherwise monolithic
      opus of pain and despair.
 
CROW: Cambot, roll the clip!
 
[Cambot flashes the following text on screen:]
 
>> "What in the world?" Marrissa exclaimed.  Then she too was
>> knocked out.
>> [...]
>> "Someone tried to use your head as an anvil," Doctor Bashir
>> responded.
 
[Cambot switches back to Mike, Tom, and Crow.  They sigh in unison, 
 and look much more relaxed and happy.]
 
MIKE: Again please, Cambot?
 
>> "What in the world?" Marrissa exclaimed.  Then she too was
>> knocked out.
>> "Someone tried to use your head as an anvil," Doctor Bashir
>> responded.
 
[Mike, Tom, and Crow again sigh in unison.]
 
TOM:  And one more time?
 
>> "What in the world?" Marrissa exclaimed.  Then she too was
>> knocked out.
>> "Someone tried to use your head as an anvil," Doctor Bashir
>> responded.
 
[Again with the unison sighs and smiles.]
 
MIKE: Feel better, guys?
 
CROW: Nope.
 
TOM:  Afraid not, Mike.
 
MIKE: Me neither.  Oh, Dr. F. is calling.  [taps Mads light]
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: So, you survived another one?  Much as it may surprise you, I'm 
      glad.
 
[SOL]
 
ALL:  *Really*?
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Oh, don't get me wrong.  One of these days I *will* find just the 
      right combination of movies and usenet posts to utterly crush your 
      spirits and annihilate your souls.  But today, I needed to
      calibrate your responses for a new experiment.  Now that that's 
      done, I'm ready to launch ... Phase Two.
 
[SOL]
 
TOM:  I hope that doesn't mean someone made a pre-quel to "Phase IV."
 
MIKE: ... a pre-quel to *what*?
 
[Deep 13]
 
Dr.F: Pay attention, boys, you're about to witness....
 
[Dr. F. is interrupted as three men suddenly appear in Deep 13 amidst 
 cheap sparkling special effects.  They are dressed in identical Armani 
 suits and carrying identical doe skin leather briefcases.  They also 
 wear ST:TNG communicators on their lapels.]
 
LAWYER 1: Dr. Clayton Forrester?  We represent Paramount Studios.  We 
          have a cease-and-desist order for all activities relating to 
          your theme park, a lawsuit for one billion dollars for 
          copyright and trademark infringement, and a lien on Deep 13
          and all of its equipment.
 
[Lawyer 2 opens his briefcase and hands Dr. F. a sheaf of papers.]
 
[Dr. F. looks concerned for a moment, then smiles.]
 
Dr.F: [pleasantly]  Friends, please... give me a chance to explain!  The 
      Marrissa-Land project is the result of *much* soul-searching on my 
      part!  I have made it my life-long ambition to spread madness and 
      evil wherever I can.  Surely the creators of Star Trek (tm) would 
      not blame me for following the dictates of my conscience!  Would 
      they?  [an even bigger pleasant smile]
 
[Lawyers draw weapons which look like ST:TOS gun-type phasers.]
 
LAWYER 1: I'm sorry, but this is a legal matter and conscience just 
          doesn't enter into it.  Now hand over all materials relating 
          to Marrissa-Land, and vacate these premises!
 
Dr.F: [laughs most unpleasantly]  You're not the only one with nifty 
      gadgets, you know.  Do you think that your Masters are the 
      only ones with a legal department?  Did you really think my 
      associates would leave me helpless?  [more evil laughter]  Now, 
      watch and learn!
 
[Dr. F. picks up a large Plexiglas container from behind his console, and
 puts it on the floor.  The container holds three large rats, a water 
 bottle, wood chips and a dish of food pellets.  He takes the cover off 
 the container and picks up a cheap-looking wand with a tin-foil-covered 
 star on the end.  He waves it at the rats.]
 
Dr.F: BIPPITY BOPPITY BOO!
 
[There is a shower of sparks and a puff of smoke.  When the smoke clears, 
 the container and its contents are gone.  In their place are three men 
 dressed identically to the Paramount lawyers, with identical briefcases. 
 The difference is that, instead of communicator pins, they have Mickey 
 Mouse ears on their heads.]
 
Dr.F: GET 'EM!
 
[Before any shots can be fired, the three newcomers growl and leap
 upon the Paramount lawyers.  Massive scuffling ensues.  Throughout 
 the struggle, they variously shout, "COUNTER-SUIT!"  "PROMISSORY 
 ESTOPPEL!"  "COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES!"  "RESTRAINING ORDER!" 
 "VESTED REMAINDER SUBJECT TO OPEN!"  "I'VE GOT YOUR EXHIBIT-A RIGHT 
 HERE!"  "PAROL EVIDENCE RULE, MY HAIRY BUTT!"  "IS THAT AN OFFICIALLY 
 LICENSED MICKEY MOUSE HAT?" Etc.]
 
[Dr. F. leers into the monitor while trying to avoid getting caught 
 in the mayhem.]
 
Dr.F: Well, Nelson, Phase Two will have to wait a few minutes while I 
      straighten out things down here.  Don't get too comfortable!  
      HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA --- OOOOOOFFFFF!!
 
[Two struggling lawyers slam into Forrester from behind, sending him 
 sprawling over the console, accidentally pushing the button.]

>>    "I'm glad it makes sense to you, Glinn," Marrissa replied.  
>> "It makes very little for me."
