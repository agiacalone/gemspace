"Time Speeder, I'm begining to wish I never posted that story."

[No theme song.  The scene simply opens on...]

[The Edge of the Universe.  In the background is the abandoned Satellite of  Love, bathed in the eerie glow of a mystical light.  Six multi-colored  balls of light frolic amongst the stars.  Two of the colored lights, Cambot  and Magic Voice, are silent.  The others -- Mike, Tom, Crow, and Gypsy --  are laughing and cheering as they play.]

GYPSY(Purple light): Whee!  Hey, this is fun!
CROW(Yellow light): Yeah!  Bein' all-knowing and all-powerful and stuff  is really pretty cool!
TOM(Red light): Hey, Mike, race ya to Proxima Centauri!
MIKE(Blue-white light): You're on!

[Tom and Mike "line up" in preparation for the race.]

TOM: Okay, ready... set... GO!!

[Tom starts to move, but abruptly stops.  Mike darts off-screen.]

TOM: <laughs>

[Mike returns from off-camera, moving slower.]

MIKE: Hey, that's not funny.
TOM: All knowledge is clear to you, and yet you *still* fall for that  old gag! <laughs again>
CROW: Hey, Tom!  It's *really* impressive and all that you can trick Mike with dumb old jokes, but can you bend space to your will?  Watch this!

[Crow disappears, then instantaneously reappears in another place.]

GYPSY: Neat!
TOM: Neat?  That's nothing.  I've been able to do that since Crow here was still in training wheels.  I can control both time *and* space!
CROW: Oh, you can not.
TOM: Can too!
CROW: Can not!
TOM: Can too!
CROW: Can too!
TOM: Can not-- D'OH!

[Everyone but Tom giggles.]

TOM: Okay, goldenrod, I'll *prove* it to you!  Watch THIS!!

[Tom begins shaking back and forth.]

GYPSY: Are you sure this is really a good--
MIKE: Be careful, Tom, you could--

[All of the balls of light disappear.  A moment later, so does the SOL.]

[Bridge of the SOL.  Mike, Tom, Crow, and Gypsy blink into existence.  They  have returned to their corporeal forms.]

TOM: See?  I *told* you I could do it!
MIKE: Yah!  We're back on the Satellite of Love!
TOM: Yep!
CROW: <looking out window> Looks like we're back in Earth orbit.

[They all just stand there for a moment.]

CROW: Huh.
MIKE: Okay, that's enough, Tom.  Send us back.
TOM: No problem.  Here goes!

[Tom begins shaking back and forth again.  Nothing happens.]

TOM: Um... let me try that again.

[Tom does it again.  Still nothing.]

TOM: Oh poopie...
MIKE: What's wrong?
TOM: <weakly> I, uh, no longer seem to be able to bend space and time  to my will... heh heh... oops...
CROW: Oh, *good* one, Servo.
MIKE: You mean to tell me that you sent us all back in time to a point at which we no longer have our non-corporeal powers?!
TOM: Pretty much.  Um... are you mad?
GYPSY: Mike's not the one you have to worry about, you little SNOT!

[Gypsy lunges for Tom.  Tom hides under the counter while Mike holds her back, trying to prevent her from smashing Tom.]

GYPSY: Let me at him!  Let me at him!
MIKE: Come on, calm down, Gypsy!

[Gypsy begins to calm.]

MIKE: There you go.  It's no big deal, all right?  We just have to figure out a way to get back.  Okay?
GYPSY: Okay.
MIKE: Now, let's find out exactly when we are...

[Mike pushes the Mads button.]

MIKE: Um... sirs?  Or sir?  Or madam?  Whoever?  Hello?

[Deep 13.  There are stacks of boxes everywhere, but no sign of any of  the Mads.  Finally, Dr. Forrester enters, carrying  another box.  He sets down the box and prepares to return for another when he glances at the  screen and does a double-take.]

DR.F: Hello, Mike, botkins.  You're early today.  You just caught me in  in middle of a little redecorating.  You see, Mother just arrived, and while I had planned on letting her stay in Frank's old bedroom, it turns out that she needs more space than an Iron Maiden can  provide.  Hence, the boxes.
MOM F: <offscreen> Clayton!  Your mother needs some help with her steamer  trunk!
DR.F: <shouting> In a minute, Mother! <to Mike> Anyway, I hadn't planned on beginning this week's experiment until later, but since you seem   *so* eager... <laughs evilly>  Your movie today is a little space-turd called "Night of the Blood Beast," and...

[SOL.]

MIKE: Seen it.

[D13.]

DR.F: <shocked> Wha...?  You've *seen* it?

[SOL.]

MIKE: Sure.  Astronaut get impregnated by shrimp.  Goofy monster that looks like a parrot and sounds like Bogart.  You know.

[D13.]

DR.F: Ah.  I see.
MOM F: <offscreen>  CLAYTON!!!
DR.F: IN A MINUTE, MOTHER!

[Dr. Forrester bends down and picks up a box full of tapes.  He rifles through them, looking at the titles.]

DR.F: Well then, I'll just have to go with plan B.  This movie is called "The Brute Man," and it stars Rondo Hatton as...

[SOL.]

CROW: Oh, we've seen that one, too.

[D13.]

DR.F: You have?!  Well, what about "Deathstalker?"  "Escape 2000?"  "The Incredible Melting Man?"  "Laserblast?"

[SOL.]

MIKE: Seen 'em.
TOM: Taped 'em.
CROW: Hated 'em.

[D13.  Mother Forrester has entered and is standing behind Dr. Forrester, who is searching frantically through the box of tapes.]

DR.F: <panicked> You've... seem them... all?!  How could...
MOM F: CLAYTON!!!
DR.F: <flinching> Yah!
MOM F: I need help carrying my steamer trunk!  Would you let your poor old  mother strain her back lifting it all by herself?
DR.F: No, Mother... I just... ran into a little problem here...
MOM F: So I heard.  Can't even keep your own evil experiments organized. <sigh> What would your father say?

[Mother tsk-tsks and walks off-screen.]

DR.F: Look, Mike, I'm a bit busy so...

[Forrester reaches off-screen and retrieves a computer disk.]

DR.F: Why don't you have a look at this?  I *was* going to save it for a special occasion, for when your spirit was about to be broken, but... <sigh> It's called "Time Speeder," and it's by Stephen Ratliff.  Enjoy.

[SOL.  Mike, Tom, and Crow are aghast.]

CROW: Stephen... Ratliff?
MIKE: Tom, are you ABSOLUTELY SURE you can't get us back?!

[Tom begins shaking violently.]

GYPSY: I'm outta here.

[Gypsy exits stage right.  Alarms and buzzers go off.]

MIKE: AAAAAH!  WE GOT RATLIFF SIGN!  NOOOOOOO!!!


6... 5... 4... 3... 2... *...


[Mike and the bots enter the theater.]

CROW: Tom, I will never, ever speak to you again.
TOM: <sniffling> I'm sorry... I didn't know...
MIKE: All right, you guys.  Let's get it together.  We've got to fight off this fanfic, and it won't help if we're bickering and arguing over  who killed who.  Okay, guys?  Team?
CROW: Okay, team.

CROW: Did you know that if you scramble his name and leave out a few  letters, you get "Saten Filter"?

TOM: But on the inside, he was filled with E-Z Cheese.

> You would  have never guessed that those brown eyes and >brown hair covered a obsessed  man.  

CROW: Well, if I were covered with eyes and hair, I guess I'd be obsessed,   too. 

> Most people believed that Starfleet was 

MIKE: ...the creation of several tedious, overrated television shows.
                          
>                                         an organization devoted to 
> Science and Exploration which also protected the Federation's borders.  

TOM: So Starfleet's responsible for stopping the Taco Bell ads?
                                     
> Lyam believed that it was a military organization just waiting >for an  opening to take over the Federation.  

CROW: But unfortunately there were darn few positions available, and they  always hired from within. 

> He was willing to die for his convictions,
> and he wasn't the only one.
>       However times being what they where, he did not need to >die.   He had a plan instead.  

MIKE: <Rowan Atkinson> A plan so cunning, you could pin a tail on it and call  it a weasel!

> In order to carry out that plan however he needed a 
> constitution class starship.  

TOM: ...and two cotton balls, a blender, and a rubber hose.

> This was not an easy item to find but if you 
> looked hard enough one could be bought or 'borrowed'.

CROW: Man, these college scavenger hunts are getting brutal...

>       As for why he wanted one, that was simple, perhaps too >simple.

MIKE: Perhaps simple enough that this story will need an enormous amount of  padding.
TOM: You can bet on it.

> Seeking more information to further his theory on Starfleet a >friend of his  had tapped into Starfleet's mission log recorders. 

TOM: Yup, just about anybody can do that, right? 
CROW: I wonder if they used a Macintosh Powerbook, like in "Independence Day."
MIKE: Or "Mission: Impossible."
TOM: Or "Hackers."
CROW: Or "The Net."

> In particular, those of  the original Enterprise.  Lyam laughed >at the irony that Starfleet would  provide it's own undoing.

MIKE: He may be a homicidal maniac, but you gotta admit, he's got a great  sense of humor!

>       Marrissa Amber Picard, Princess, heir to the throne of >Essex, Chief helmsman, 

TOM: ...athlete, denture wearer...

>                 starship Enterprise, 

CROW: She's a starship, now, too?
MIKE: <Marrissa> I *am* the starship Enterprise!  ZOOOOM!!!

>                                     was packing some of her stuff up in 
> preparation for transfer, 

TOM: <Marrissa>  Hmmm... Double D batteries... all of Starfleet Barbie's   accessories... oh, where did I put that spray bottle of Riker-Away -  can't let him get too close to me...

>                          when her adopted father entered her room >caring   the sleeping form of his one and a half year old >daughter Jackie.  "I knew  Jackie was annoying you, but >enough for you to 

CROW: ...kill her?!

>                                                pack for a sleep over at 
> Clara's?" her father commented.  

CROW: Oh.

> "I'll have to watch her more carefully."

MIKE: And I'll have to make that garbage disposal childproof sometime.

>       "Dad, did you even read the transfers you approved last >week?"
> Marrissa asked.   "I'm packing to join the Stargazer as her >second officer and fighter commander.  You approved."

TOM: <whiny kid voice> Daaaaadd, you said I could!

>       "I can honestly say that I just signed them and sent them >off," Jean-Luc Picard said.  "I didn't even look at them.  

CROW: <Picard> You know me.  I never look at what I'm signing.  That's how  I ended up adopting you, remember?

> You say you are  leaving.  I didn't know."  

MIKE: <singing> You say you're leaving, well I didn't know - let it show,  yeah, let it show.

>                           He kidded lightheartedly.

TOM: Hey, I'd be lighthearted if Marrissa was leaving me.

>       "And Vulcan froze over," Marrissa replied.  

CROW: Hahaha!  Give it up for the future empress of the galaxy, folks!

> "Since you  encouraged Lieutenant Lockard to apply for the >Chief Tactical Officer  position and backed him very strongly, >after my request pasted your desk  I'd say you know quite >well."

MIKE: Hmmmm... I think some wood glue would be more appropriate.

>       "Can I get anything past you?" the Admiral asked.
>       "Maybe a torpedo at warp 9," Marrissa joked.  

TOM: <Picard> Don't tempt me.

> "You do realize that your pushing Lockard made you lose >your chief helmsman, one of your  more promising Security >officers and the assistant chief helmsman."

CROW: He's taken them all hostage.

>       "Lieutenant Szustakowski?" her father asked.  

ALL: Gesundheit.

> "I haven't seen her request yet."
>       "Ross asked her to marry him last night," Marrissa >replied. "She dropped off the transfer request and a request for >you to marry them

MIKE: <Marrissa> But this time don't insist on your right to sleep with the  bride beforehand, okay, Dad?

> while you were singing Jackie to sleep with the Doctor."

TOM: Either Picard was singing a duet with Doctor Crusher, or he was singing a song called "Jackie" to get Crusher to sleep with him.
CROW: Either way, it's just wrong.

>       "Well tell Captain Washington that I sent four of my best >when you pick her up at Deep Space Nine," Picard said.  

MIKE: Your best what?  Marbles?  Wigs?  Eight-sided dice?  What?

> "I assume you have taken care of your Kid's crew."

MIKE: <pointing to head> You mean "take care" of them??
CROW: No, no, I mean take her out to dinner, show her a good time...

>       "Yes, Clara will take over when I leave," Marrissa said.
> "Alexander moves to first officer, Patterson takes second."

TOM: <Harry Caray> ...just beating the throw by a step!
 
>       "Who replaces Alexander at Ops?" her father asked.
>       "You will have to ask Clara that," Marrissa replied.  >"You  better get Jackie to bed before she wakes up."

MIKE: Not only is she the best officer in Starfleet history, but now she's giving parenting tips.

>       "I will, Marrissa," Admiral Picard responded.  

CROW: <John Cleese> Yes, *dear*, I'm doing it, *dear*...

> "Have Princess  Clarrissa see me sometime tomorrow."

TOM: I want her to explain it all.

>       "I'll tell her royal highness that you wanted to see her,"
> Marrissa responded.

MIKE: <sarcastic> Oh, *thank* you *soooo* much.

>       "I assume since you are leaving Kid's Crew command, are >you giving up the position of supervision officer of all Kid's >crew," the  Admiral stated.

CROW: *Please* say you're giving up supervision of the Kid's Crew.  *Please*.

>       "Unfortunately not," Marrissa said.  "I told Admiral >Necheyev  that I'd like to foster that position off on Jay >Gordon, but she didn't  see the need for me to leave that >position.  

TOM: By the way, could you tell me what she meant by "Burn, baby, burn?"

> I've got to be serving in 
> the most unique position in Starfleet.  

ALL: *giggle*
MIKE: Okay, can we come up with a clean riff here?
CROW: Um...
TOM: How about, those years of contortionist school are finally paying off!
MIKE: Good work! 

> I'll be Starfleet's first fighter 
> commander since fighters went out of service back in 2290.  

CROW: Let's hope for a reenactment of "Tora Tora Tora."

> I'm a Lieutenant  Commander with clearance of a full >Admiral, because I'm also the heir to  the throne of Essex.  

TOM: So Starfleet just hands over top security clearance to royalty on any   ol' dumb planet?!

> In addition on the Stargazer I'll have under my 
> command about 30 Cardassians.  

MIKE: Woo hoo!  Now we have someone to root for!

> If that wasn't enough, I'm the supervising   officer of the Kid's >Crew program, which covers two dozen starships.  

CROW: Are they all as annoying as Marrissa's?

> How  a shy little girl like me every got in such a position is a >mystery."

ALL: *sigh*
TOM: Easy, Marrissa - you've got a bad writer doing your stories for you.

>       "Marrissa, you haven't been shy since you broke Sel Rahc >Selaw's  legs," Admiral Picard exclaimed.  

MIKE: <Marrissa> Hey, he owed me money!
CROW: Homicidal, yes.  Psychotic, yes.  Shy, not particularly.

> This of coarse caused Jackie to wake up  and yawn.

TOM: We hear ya, darlin'.

>       "I told you you should have put her to bed," Marrissa >commented.

MIKE: Along with your dreams of becoming a writer, Steve-o.

>       "Jackie no bed," the little girl in Admiral Picard's arms >said.

CROW: Man, the Sioux must *really* be running out of names to call themselves.

>       "Oh yes you are, my little lady," her father replied.
>       "Come on Jackie, I'll read you a story," Marrissa replied.  

MIKE: Once upon a time, a power-mad 13-year-old overthrew a powerful  starfaring society...

> "If  you go to bed, you can be up early enough to look over >my new ship before  I leave."
>       "'Rissa leave?" Jackie asked.

TOM: <Jackie> Please?

>       "Not till tomorrow," Marrissa told her little sister.
>       " 'Rissa no leave."

TOM: <Jackie> Damn!

> 
> Chapter One

CROW: Audience 0.

> 
>       Clara Sutter and Marrissa were saying their good-byes >before the Stargazer meet the Enterprise.  "I'll miss you >Marrissa," Clara said.

MIKE: Well, don't lead her so much then, Clara - just point and squeeze  the trigger.

>       "I know you will, Clara," Marrissa replied.  

TOM: <Marrissa> I know everything, after all.

> "but you are going  to leave for Starfleet Academy in a >couple months.  I'll try to arrange  to be your transportation."

CROW: I guess she really *is* the starship Enterprise.

>       "OK," Clara said.  "but, I want you to promise me one >thing."
>       "What's that," Marrissa asked.

MIKE: Never come back!!

>       "Thanks to your encouragement, I have a promising >Engineering  career," Clara said.  "Don't get yourself killed.  

TOM: <Clara> *I* want to be the one who... uh, never mind.

> I'd like to become  Chief Engineer some day and becoming a >Queen, as you once said, is not  conductive to a career in >Starfleet."

CROW: What a shocking comment. <pause> See, conductive... electricity...   oh well.

>       "OK, but you have to promise to take good care of my >Kid's Crew," Marrissa said.  "I put a lot of time into making >them the best  and I don't want it to go to waste."

MIKE: Oh, *your* time, *your* Kid's Crew!  What about *my* needs?

>       "Deal," Clara promised.  "Do you a have any advice for >me on  that?"

TOM: One word: Ritalin.

>       "Just remember that you have to be willing to make the >big  decisions," Marrissa said.  

CROW: <Marrissa> Chemise or teddy?  Pink nailpolish or purple?  And, of   course, bra or no bra?  Of course, that'll never be a problem for   *you*....

> "When you are in command, you have 1000+ 
> lives in your hand.  

MIKE: Remember to wash it before you eat.

> Be firm and decisive.  Hesitation is something to  avoid.  

TOM: <Marrissa> So is thinking.  Just shoot first and ask questions later.   That's what I've always done, and look where it's gotten me!

> Other than that, just be yourself.  Don't try to copy anyone >else.  

CROW: <Marrissa> Not even me, although I *know* you want to, stupid  copycatter.

> That leads to defeat."

MIKE: ...and the Dark Side of the Force.

>       "Marrissa, you are a fountain of wisdom," Clara replied.

TOM: In the same way a broken toilet is a fountain of wisdom.

>       "I'm just repeating what Commander Riker told me," >Marrissa  responded.

CROW: Well, the clean parts, anyway.

>       "Admiral Picard to Lieutenant Commander Marrissa >Picard."
>    "Marrissa here."

MIKE: <intercom voice> Oh.  Uh, whoops.  <background> No luck, she's still   here.

>       "The Stargazer has arrived," her father said.  "They are >waiting  for you to beam aboard."

TOM: <Marrissa> Oh, they can wait... I'll thrill their little lives soon   enough.

>       "Tell them I'll be right over, Marrissa out," she said, >closing  the channel, then suddenly nervous she turned to >Clara.  

CROW: <Marrissa> Um... I've never done this with a girl before, but...

> "Care to walk  me to the Transporter Room, Clara?"
>       "I'd love to."

MIKE: If only to make sure that you finally leave.

> 
>       When Marrissa entered the deck on which transporter >room 3 was located, she found her entire Kid's crew lined up >in their navy blue  and yellow, red, or medium blue uniform.  

TOM: This sounds like the introduction to a logic problem.

> "Attention on deck," Clara  ordered.  They snapped to >attention.

CROW: Ready... aim... FIRE!!!

>       As Marrissa walked thought the assembled children she >commented,

MIKE: <Marrissa> Oh, you must be the little people I stepped on to get where  I am now.  I don't think I ever noticed you before.

> "You managed to keep this a secret, very surprising Clara.  I >thought I'd  hear of something like this."  

TOM: <Marrissa> I will have my spies executed for this.

> As she reached the transporter room door  and the end of the >line Marrissa turned around.  "Ladies and Gentlemen, I 
> thank you for your service and friendship on this ship.  

CROW: Well, your service, anyway.

> You will find a  personal note from me along with a token of >my thanks when you return to  your quarters. 

MIKE: Please do not be disturbed when the alien fungus starts growing on your  hands.

> It has been my pleasure serving with you."  Marrissa 
> entered the transporter room.

ALL: <raucous cheer>
TOM: <kid voice> She's leaving!  Our long galactic nightmare is over!!

>       Inside the room her Kid's crew command crew and the >Adult Command crew stood.  

CROW: The Adult crew is the one with the skimpy leather uniforms.

> Clara took her place behind the console.  "Well '
> this is a surprise," Marrissa commented as the door closed.

MIKE: A dull surprise, apparently.

>       "You didn't give us much time, but the Command Crew >of the  Enterprise-E would like to convey it's appreciation of >your service  aboard this ship," Admiral Jean-Luc Picard said.  

TOM: ...and its even greater appreciation of your *future* service *not* aboard this ship.

> "Since you have shown a  certain fondness for >commemorative plaques, we made one for you.  

CROW: That's Marrissa -- she's fond of any sort of trophy honoring her  dominance.

> It reads,

MIKE: Dear Marrissa: Bite me.  Sincerely, the crew of Enterprise-E.

>       For her service on board both the Enterprise-D and E the

TOM: <Marrissa> Flores, you forgot the Flores!  I am displeased, infidel!

>                                       Princess of Essex, 
>       and heir to throne of that world, 

CROW: Yes, folks, just in case you forgot, Marrissa is also heir to the throne of Essex.  We cannot stress this fact enough.

CROW: <Marrissa> Yeah, whatever.  Hand over the loot.

TOM: <Clara> You better like this -- we robbed three Starbases to pay for it.

MIKE: We're feeling kind today, and will only fire warning shots.

CROW: Oops, that should read, "We have known no others *who* like you."

>    We believe no one can  replace you. 

TOM: At least we hope not.

>                    Your encouragement has meant a lot to us.

CROW: <Shayna> Thanks, you done?  You want me to collapse in shame, is that it?  Am I your punching bag?

CROW: Whoa... *two* colors of wallpaper!

TOM: The next thing she noticed was the increased complexity of Admiral Scott.
MIKE: <Marrissa> Yikes!  I didn't know Starfleet *made* uniforms that big!

>       "Granted, lassie," Scotty replied.  

CROW: <Scotty> I'm Scottish, by the way!

> "Or should I be calling yea  Princess?"
>       "Just Marrissa will be fine," Marrissa responded.  

TOM: Or 'High Lord and Master.'

> "I dislike titles, although I've accumulated a lot of them.  

ALL: <laugh>
MIKE: Oh, come on!  Marrissa dislikes titles the same way Courtney Love dislikes getting high once in a while.

> What are you doing aboard?"

CROW: It's more fun than floating around in the vacuum outside.

>       "I came aboard to see to the final tests, then I discovered >that  you'd be going to my next stop so I hitched a ride.  I >assume you consider  yourself aboard?"

TOM: No, I think I'm more of a lampshade.  Yeesh.

>       "Of coarse," Marrissa replied.

MIKE: I consider myself a coarse board!

>       "Computer Recognize Scott, Admiral Montgomery, and >transfer  command to Lieutenant Commander Marrissa >Amber Picard, per Starfleet orders.

CROW: <computer> God help us all.

>       "I though as an Admiral, you would want to be in >command," Marrissa stated.

TOM: Standard Ratliffian regulations.  Youngest and/or lowest-ranking officer on board is automatically given command.

>       "Marrissa, my lass, I never wanted command," Scotty >said.  

MIKE: Unless it was of something over 80 proof.

CROW: Though the million-dollar raises are nice too.

>       "Since our Chief Engineer has yet to be assigned, I >assume you are filling that position?" Marrissa asked.
>       "Aye."    

TOM: Filling it out quite thoroughly, I'm sure.
MIKE: With enough left over for two or three *other* positions.

>       "What's the dirtiest place on the ship?" Marrissa asked.

CROW: That'd be the Red Light district, deck 12.

>       "It's just been refit so it's petty clean, but I'd have to say

TOM: Recycling center?!  What, does it turn old aluminum cans into antimatter?

CROW: ...since there's just two us on this ship...

>       "Where will he start?" Scotty asked.

TOM: He's always lookin' for my stash, man!

>       Marrissa entered the suite of rooms dedicated for the use >of the  Second Officer.  They were located next to the Ship's >bar which was named  Seven Slightly Starboard for it's >location.  

ALL: <weak laughter>
MIKE: Does it hurt much being *you*, Steve-o?

> Marrissa paused for a moment 
> as the irony of the fact that the only officer on board who >wasn't of  legal age's quarters would be next to the bar hit her.  

CROW: So the Ages have quarters... and the bar hit Marrissa?
TOM: <Marrissa> Ow! I've been hit by a serious collapse of syntax!

> The first room   she entered was an office.  In contained a >desk, a couple chairs and a sofa under the window.  The desk >was perpendicular to outside wall.  She  hung the painting >Data had given her behind the desk.  

MIKE: Okay, this is a logic puzzle, right?  He's going to ask us "on what wall did she hang the painting?" or "how long did it take to reach  Starbase 32?"

> Across the room was  the door to the rest of her quarters, next >to the replicator.  

CROW: Uh-oh-- if she hits the wrong button, we have to deal with multiple  Marrissas!

> She walked though it 

TOM: She walked through the replicator?

>                  to discover a well apportioned room with a table >and three chairs, another sofa and a double bed.  

MIKE: <Marrissa> They expect me to live in *this* closet?  Where am I going to  put all my commemorative plaques and pictures of me?  There's no mirror  over my bed, either!  I'll have someone's career for this!

> The far wall sported another  opening which lead to a >bathroom with a real tub, perfect for Marrissa's  bubble baths.

CROW: Don't go there, Ratliff... no matter *how* much you want to.

>       As Marrissa exited the bathroom her door chimed.  

TOM: Maybe it'll be Norman Bates?
MIKE: We should be so lucky.

> Walking back to her office, Marrissa said, "Come."  

[A man's shadow appears on the left side of the theater.  He is wearing a robe -- leopard skin, most likely -- and is holding a pipe.]

CZAPLINSKI: Yeah baby, yeah baby, yeah YEAH!

[The man disappears.]

CROW: Well.  *That* was strange.

> A young woman entered tentatively.  
> She was carrying the rest of Marrissa's belongings.
>       "The Quartermaster said you wanted this," she said, >indicating  the stuff she was carrying.  

MIKE: Starfleet discovered to have enlisted personnel!  Film at 11!

> "Just put it on my desk, Crewman ?" Marrissa  said >ndicating that she wanted to know the older woman's name.

CROW: <shakes head> Gotta give it to Ratliff - he writes what he knows.
TOM: And what he knows is clumsiness.

>       "Peterson, Yeoman Diane Peterson," the crewman >replied.  "The  Quartermaster has assigned me to be your >yeoman."

MIKE: Ouch.  What'd she do to deserve that - sell Federation secrets to  the Cardassians?

>       "Well then, Yeoman, get ready for a lot of work," >Marrissa  responded.  "I probably hold the most jobs of >anyone on the ship."

CROW: That is, if you include running your mouth, self-worship, and otherwise  being an annoying twink as jobs.

>       "How so?" Yeoman Peterson asked, curious.  "I know >you are Second Officer, but what else?"

ALL: *sigh*
TOM: Here we go again, folks -- another recitation of Marrissa's titles.

>       "I'm also Fighter Commander," Marrissa responded.  

MIKE: Well, wing commander, really, but there's some sort of copyright trouble.

> "Plus I'm also the coordinating officer for all the Kid's Crews >in the fleet.  

CROW: <Peterson> *You're* the one to blame for that?

> If  that weren't enough, I've got the responsibilities outside >Starfleet of  being the heir to the constitutional monarchy of >Essex.  

TOM: <Marrissa> And I was the made the Warrior-Goddess of Kricfalusi 18 when  the Vulture People attacked the peaceful Eagle kingdom and I fought them  all off all by myself, yes I did, and, and, and I got a magic sword and  big crown and everything!
MIKE: Careful, Tom - you're probably giving Ratliff ideas for the next  Marrissa story.
TOM: D'oh!

> I've got to get  Victoria  to get married."  The last was said >under her breath.
>       "It sounds like I'll be busy, Commander," Yeoman >Peterson  responded.  

CROW: <Peterson> Well, I *suppose* I could marry Victoria...

> "Call me Marrissa, I have a dislike for titles," Marrissa  said.

TOM: <laughs> You keep saying that and it's JUST NOT TRUE!

> Then seeing Peterson's puzzled glance she continued.  "I >simply have too  many of them."

MIKE: Kinda like Ratliff fanfics - even one is too many.

MIKE: Beam the *what* over?

CROW: If this involves rubber gloves, I'm leaving.

TOM: <guard> Hey, Ted, anything happening out there? 
CROW: <guard> Well, a ship called Starfleet's Bane cruised by a few minutes 
      ago and reactivated one of our biggest warhorses. Nah, nothing 
      suspicious.

> "I'll be on the Bridge."

TOM: Hey guys, let's get underway before the fanfic notices us.
MIKE: Good idea.

[Mike and the bots exit the theater.]


*... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...


[SOL.  Crow and Tom are behind the counter.  Crow is wearing a large, goofy,
 Guinan-style hat.  Tom is wearing a similar hat, but his is much smaller.  
 Mike, who is standing off-screen to the right, ducks in front of the camera.]

MIKE: And now, Tom and Crow will re-enact the scene between Guinan and
      Mary from today's fanfic, "Time Speeder."

[Mike vanishes to the right.  Cambot zooms in on Tom and Crow.]

CROW: Hi, Mary!  
TOM: Hello, *mother*.
CROW: Long time no see!  When *did* I abandon you to that horrible bed and 
      breakfast, anyway -- fifty, sixty years ago?
TOM: Gee, I don't know, it seemed more like five hundred.    
CROW: Oh, what are you complaining about?  You made a ton of cash!
TOM: So?  I wasted the best years of my life in that dumpster of a bed
     and breakfast!
CROW: You ran at a 300 percent profit.  That's all that matters.
TOM: But you stole my youth from me!  <sigh> Anyway.  I don't suppose you've
     sobered up enough from your neverending rum-and-Coke binge to remember
     that today is my birthday, have you?
CROW: Today's your birthday?  <pause> Oh yeah!  I guess it is!
TOM: Uh huh.  Well, don't feel bad that you forgot.  I've gotten used to
     that over the last ninety years.  In fact, when was the last time you
     even realized I existed?  Or mentioned me to anybody else?  Why is it
     that everyone you know doesn't know you even had a daughter?
CROW: Um... the subject just never came up, that's all.  Nobody asked me
      if I had a daughter, so...
TOM: And while you're at it, how about telling me who my father is, hmmm?
CROW: Well, see, I can't, because... <pause> Why wouldn't I?  This doesn't
      make any sense.  I can't do this, Mike!

[Mike steps back in front of Cambot.]

MIKE: Crow, what are you doing?!  You're stepping out of character!
CROW: But I don't understand the character I'm trying to step *into*!  Mike,
      Guinan on TNG is *completely* different from Ratliff's version of her!
      On the show, Guinan doesn't have a daughter, and she's wise and kind
      and stuff.  But Ratliff makes her seem greedy and callous and mean and
      irresponsible...
MIKE: Crow, this is Ratliff.  *Every* character is written that way.
CROW: I know, but this is different somehow.
TOM: You know what I think?  I think Ratliff's being a racist bastard.
MIKE: Huh?
TOM: Don't you see?  Guinan is black, and in Steve's little world, that
     means she wouldn't know who the father of her child is.  Ratliff's
     Guinan is a 24th century version of the stereotypical inner-city 
     welfare mom.
MIKE: Oh, I don't know...
CROW: Well, it *would* make sense.  Ratliff *is* from the South, after all.
TOM: <harsh whisper> Crow, no!
CROW: What?
MIKE: I think you may be reading a little too much into this.  Come on, 
      let's finish out the skit.
TOM: What, now?  After all of this pontification?
MIKE: What else would you suggest we do?  Just sit quietly until the next
      Fanfic Sign?
CROW: Well, yeah!  I know *I* can't go on after this.
MIKE: Um... okay.

[Mike, Tom, and Crow sit quietly for a bit.  Then lights and buzzers go off,
 and the typical pandemonium ensues.]

ALL: WE GOT FANFIC SIGN!!! 
MIKE: ...thank God!

[Mike and the bots enter the theater.]

MIKE: Well, *that* was odd...

> Captain's Log 
> USS Stargazer NCC-2893

TOM: Can we expect a replay of what happened to the last Stargazer?
MIKE: Don't think so, Tommy.
TOM: Darn.

CROW: We noticed a major invasion force coming in this morning, but that's 
      not part of our jurisdiction.

> 
>         Marrissa surveyed the bridge of the Stargazer.  

MIKE: ...and then bid four no-trump.

TOM: And it's LOCHARD again, instead of LOCKARD.
CROW: Jeez, Stephen -- pick a spelling and stay with it!

> Over on the forward port corner, stood the Operations console where some
> ensign  Marrissa didn't know sat.  

MIKE: Ensign Throwaway?

> Next to the Captains chair on the

TOM: Okay folks, we're gonna let you make up your own joke here.

> Directly behind

CROW: Normally, Ross is strung up from the ceiling by his ankles.
MIKE: It's a wonder anyone makes it to Captain with their knees intact.

TOM: The video poker games.

CROW: Gosh.  How unique.

>         "Captain, I'm detecting a vessel exceeding warp 5," Ross said.

MIKE: <Ross> Can I turn on the siren now?  Pretty please??

>        "Operations?" Marrissa asked

TOM: The goofy game for loopy lieutenants?

>         "Warp signature confirmed, civilian pre-refined warp drive," the

MIKE: Real Stories of the Highway Patrol!

>         "Registration?" Marrissa inquired.

CROW: <jock> Oh, yeah, I hate that, too - you gotta wait in line to get the 
      classes you want, and then some dink physics major with tape on his 
      glasses gets it just `cause he's got a better GPA than you--
MIKE: Crow! Snap out of it!
CROW: *shakes his head* aggida-aggida-aggida. Sorry, Mike.

>         "The ship is transmitting the registry of DSK-63689, which is
> listed as the Freeport Rover out of  Carse," Ross replied.

MIKE: Johnny Carse?
CROW: <Carson> I won't say the Freeport Rover is slow, but it took it all 
      day to get to first base with Madonna!
TOM: <Ed McMahon> Hey-oooo!

>         "Kathy set a coarse to intercept them in 5 minutes," Marrissa

TOM: I need a moment to freshen up before we have guests.

MIKE: How can there be traffic violations in outer space?
TOM: Mike, this is Ratliff; he probably thinks that traffic cops *are* aliens.
CROW: Y'know, I don't think Ratliff ever even got his driver's license.
TOM: Yeah - he probably had a "Magic" tournament to go to that day.

> Something tells me this is a repeat

CROW: <Marrissa> My Spidey sense is tingling.

>         "The Freeport Rover is responding," the ensign at operations

TOM: It's sitting on its hind legs and begging, sir!  <quietly>  Cause, see, 
     it's the Freeport 'Rover'... heh heh...

>         "On screen," Marrissa responded as Ross handed her a PADD over
> her shoulder.
>         A black haired man appeared on the screen, "This is the
> Freeport Rover out of Carse, why are you chasing us?"  he asked.

MIKE: Let me guess - they're following Phil Silvers, Ethel Merman, and 
      Spencer Tracy to that place with the palm trees?

>         "I am Lieutenant Commander Marrissa Picard, presently commanding
> the Starfleet vessel Stargazer," Marrissa said.  

CROW: ...and that's reason enough!  Nyah!

> "I'm certain that you

TOM: Somehow I don't think this is quite what Gene Roddenberry had in mind...

MIKE: I'll have to ask you to step out of the vehicle, sir... would you mind
      opening the trunk for me?

> Prepare to receive my boarding party."

CROW: Woo!  It's like there's a party in my ship and everyone's invited!

>         "That won't be necessary," the Freeport Rover's Captain replied.

TOM: <singing> And it's no, nay, never, no never, no more, will I play 
     Freeport Rover, never, no more...

> "I'm sure we can make arrangements that so you won't have to come

MIKE: Either that, or edit me out of this story - just so I don't have to 
      talk to you any more.

>         "Sorry, Captain, but I must insist," Marrissa replied.  "Plus it

MIKE: <Captain> But I was just going to recommend a good 401(k) plan!

> Lieutenant

>         "Yes, Captain," Ross replied.
>         "My security team will be arriving in two minutes," Marrissa

CROW: <hoarse> Pepper, I'm sending you undercover to the Freeport Rover.

> "Stargazer out.  Ross, did you notice that barrel in the

TOM: Get in.

>         "You mean the one which was labeled, Medical substance,
> bio-mumentic gel," Ross replied.  

MIKE: Don't worry, that's part of his act.

> "I saw it.  I also wish to note that
> the Freeport Rover is lacking the necessary permits to carry it."

CROW: Yeah! In the future every ship that uses a red barrel is
      going to need permits.
TOM: loudly clears his throat.
CROW: Oh... yeah....

>         "I think we better call for some one to pick up the Freeport

> "I'll expect you to return with the Captain of that vessel.  

MIKE: <Goldfinger> No, Marrissa -- I expect you to die!

> Dismissed."
> 
>         Meanwhile on the Eagle,  

TOM: And now, this quick word from the plot.

>                                the anti-Starfleetites where ready to
> move.  

CROW: Anti-Starfleetites?  Isn't that the longest word in the dictionary?
TOM: No, I'm pretty sure the Anti-Starfleetites played at Red Rocks last
     summer.
MIKE: I've got it!  It's the only thing that can kill Superman, right?

> "Lyam, all systems are ready," Boris said.
>         "John set a coarse for Proxima Centauri, Warp 7," Lyam ordered.

TOM: And now, back to more Ratliff.

> 
> Captain's Log 
> USS Stargazer NCC-2893
> STARDATE 51372.35
> Lieutenant Commander Picard recording until the arrival of the Captain

MIKE: Hey... why is the ship on patrol without a captain?!  Instead of handing
      out speeding tickets, shouldn't they be going to pick her up?

>         We have dropped off the Freeport Rover and her crew at Starbase
> 329 to await trail.  

TOM: Mark Trail?

> With all the evidence against her, there is a great
> likelihood that the Freeport Rover will become property of the
> Federation Government.

MIKE: Just to make sure, we planted a bloody glove on the ship.  There's no 
      *way* they're getting off!

> 
>         Later that evening, Marrissa organized a poker game in Seven
> Slightly Starboard.  

CROW: Poker?  I don't even know her!
 
> Among the participants were, Lieutenants Ross and
> Katherine Lochard, Lieutenant Sam Lavelle, and Admiral Montgomery Scott.

TOM: Remember, these people are *nothing* without their ranks.
 
>  "I'll see your ten, and raise you 5 lassie," Scotty said.

MIKE: <Marrissa> I'll see your 5... and *stop* calling me a dog!
 
>         "I fold," Katherine said.  

TOM: I bend.
MIKE: I crinkle.
CROW: I scream in agony as we start yet another scene with no hope of action.
 
>         "I'm in," Ross stated.

TOM: --to humiliation, if he voluntarily continues to serve under Marrissa.

>         "I'll see your 15 and raise you 10," Lavelle called.
>         "Sam, you really should work on your bluff," Marrissa said.

MIKE: <Dean Stockwell> Sam, work on that bluff as I send you into the body 
      of Al Capone...

> "I'll see you and raise 10."
>         "Too rich for my blood, lassie," Scotty said.  "I fold."
>         "I'll see you and raise you 20," Sam Lavelle stated.
>         "I'll see your 20 and raise you 50," Marrissa said.

CROW: If I see *any* of you I'll raise a militia and have you all shot.

>         "Watch those cards, Kathy, Marrissa's got something," Ross
> asserted.

TOM: ...and it may be contagious.
MIKE: Contagious and fatal, I hope.

>         "I ... fold," Sam said.
>         "Like I said, work on that bluff," Marrissa said.  

CROW: ...not to mention your Shatner impression.

> "It looks
> like this hand's mine.  

TOM: Seeing as it's attached to my arm and everything.

> Since I've now won five straight hands, I'll sit
> out the next one, Kathy, your deal."  

MIKE: Since I've once again shown my complete superiority to you mere 
      mortals, I shall leave you to your mediocrity.

> Marrissa got up and went over to
> Mary, who was dusting the piano next to Marrissa's wall.  

CROW: <Mary> I still think demoting me to Ship's Maid for not referring to you 
      as "Her Royal Highness" was a bit severe.  Sir.

> "Mary, what is
> an old fashion upright piano doing in a Starfleet bar."

TOM: Wait, wait, I think I've heard this one already.

>         "Piano's have always been in bars since the ancient west on
> Earth," Mary responded.  "I here you play."

MIKE: Oh, I... get around.

>         "Not much, and I haven't practiced in ages," Marrissa said.

TOM: I've been too busy conquering the universe and stuff.

> "Sometime I'll have to pick it up again."

CROW: Wow, she can pick up pianos??
MIKE: That's nothing.  I used to be able to bench-press two Steinways and a 
      clavicle.
CROW: Really?
MIKE: No.

>         "Go ahead, try," Mary said.

TOM: But make sure you press that red button first...

>         "All right, but I'm warning you I haven't practiced in a good
> two years - maybe more," Marrissa warned.  Then she began playing the
> Blue Danube Waltz.  A little hesitant and occasionally she made a

ALL: GASP!!!
CROW: A mistake!  Marrissa made a mistake!
MIKE: We've found something Marrissa can't do!!

[Choirs of angels appear in the theater singing the Halleluiah Chorus.]

>         but on the whole it sounded pretty good.

[The music stops.  The choirs of angels disappear.]

CROW: Oh.  Well, I had a feeling it was too good to be true.
TOM: Yeah, Marrissa can do everything, can't she? She'd fit right in in one 
     of Heinlein's stories.
MIKE: Um... Tom?
TOM: I didn't mean that as a compliment.
MIKE: <obviously relieved> Oh, okay.

>         "Hey, Marrissa, this is a bar, not a consort hall," Ross
> shouted.

CROW: Hey, just because *you're* married...

>         "OK, you asked for it," Marrissa said.  

ALL: Fight!  Fight!  Fight!  Wooo!!

> "Mary, get me a
> strawberry juice."  

ALL: <disappointed> Oh.

> Ross looked over at her thinking 'not again,' 

TOM: Ross just turned into a recently-transmogrified potted plant falling 
     to the Earth?

> but Marrissa wasn't going to do that.  

MIKE: After all, she'd left the balloons in her quarters, and there was no
      trapeze handy.

> She began playing the Entertainer.

CROW: That word looks *so* out of place in a Ratliff story.

>         "Marrissa, that's still not right," Ross said back.

TOM: This whole *fanfic* is not right.

>         "Hey, you give me the music and a day to study it and maybe I'll

MIKE: Difficult piano music?  No problem!  Marrissa can play like a Carnegie
      Hall pianist in less than 24 hours!

>          otherwise, Kathy, order a strawberry juice and if your husband
> complains again, throw it on him," Marrissa responded.

CROW: And if that doesn't work, try sulfuric acid.

>         "You heard the Commander, honey, now be quiet," Katherine
> Lochard said.

TOM: <whispering> Ross!  Ixnay!  Don't piss off Marrissa!  Tick tick tick,
     remember??

>         As Marrissa continued to play, a young man phased into view

CROW: <hopefully> The Borg?

> "Are you sure you haven't been practicing?"  he whispered

MIKE: Not with anyone but you, darling...

>         Marrissa whirled around to face him.  

TOM: <Marrissa> Joe Don Baker?  In a Speedo?  For me?

> "Wesley Eugene Crusher,

ALL: NOOOOOO!!!

>                        brother, 

CROW: ...heir to the throne of Essex...
MIKE: No, you're getting your annoying brats mixed up.

>                                 what are you doing here?"
>         "Well, little sister, I though I'd drop by to see you," Wesley
> replied.

TOM: You know, it's as if Ratliff is emphasizing the fact that Wesley and 
     Marrissa are *brother* and *sister*.
MIKE: Funny, that.

>         "Wes, you never 'drop by'," Marrissa retorted.

MIKE: You always barge in and ask for money.

>         "Who said I couldn't change?" Wes replied. 

CROW: Only a couple million disgusted Trekkies.

> Then under Marrissa's

TOM: <Wes> Don't kill me...

> "Actually the Traveler said I'd be needed here."

MIKE: Are you short of umbrellas?

>         "Well if the Traveler said so, who am I to second guess him,"
> Marrissa said.  

CROW: Why stop second-guessing everyone else *now*, Marrissa?
TOM: Marrissa not knowing better than everyone else?  Now, *there's* something 
     we're not likely to see again.

CROW: That's rather generous, don't you think?  Like calling a Blind Melon

TOM: Pissssssss...
MIKE: Oh, stop it.

CROW: <Faraday> Well, you weren't here, so yeah, I guess you could say that.

TOM: I was right!
MIKE: Okay, that's it!

[Mike detaches Tom's globe and throws it across the theater.]

TOM: Hey!  I need that!

MIKE: Uh, the poker game ended last night, Scotty.

>         "Aye, sir," Scotty replied.
>         "I've found the Eagle, Captain," Ross Lochard replied.  

TOM: The Eagle has landed!
MIKE: Oh, you were just *waiting* to use that joke, weren't you.

CROW: Yeah, them V-8s can really move.

TOM: Dinner and a movie, 7pm, your place.  His name is Gary.

>         "Aye sir, it is July 26, 1996," the ensign at Ops replied.
>         "Happy negative 281st birthday Captain," Ross responded.

CROW: With this kind of comedic touch, I'm surprised Ratliff's not already in 
      Hollywood.
MIKE: He is, Crow - who do you think's been writing for "Central Park West?"

>         "Ross," Kathy admonished.  

TOM: <Kathy> ...for the last time -- shut up.

CROW: "Were their going?"  Looks like Steve finally got a spellchecker, but 
      still sees no value in proofreading...
MIKE: Maybe Ratliff put this through a reverse spellchecker?  One that makes 
      sure everything is spelled wrong?

>         "Any advice for me, big brother?" Marrissa asked Wesley.

TOM: Uh... watch out where the huskies go, and don't eat the yellow snow?

>         "Just don't let your ship be seen," Wesley replied.

CROW: <British accent> The first rule of how not to be seen: do not stand up.

>         "Admiral Scott?" Marrissa questioned.
>         "Visual and ray sensor screen active," Scotty replied.

CROW: <British accent> Mr. Scott has learned the second rule of not being 
      seen.  Unfortunately, his ship has chosen an obvious piece of cover.

>         "The Eagle has entered Earth orbit," Ross apprised.

TOM: Right alongside all those Frank Thomas home runs.

MIKE: Well, she's got that going for her, at least.

>         "I don't have much," Wesley said.  

CROW: <Marrissa> Yes, I know.  I can read the girl's room walls as easily

TOM: How do you know they want to change the past?  Maybe they just wanted to

>         "We know that Washington D.C. was the Capital of the United

MIKE: Why does Ratliff only believe it's true love if children come out of it?

TOM: Wes Cooley is offered as a sacrifice to appease the angry earth spirits.

CROW: But what would sipping Peter Jennings accomplish, though?

TOM: Let me get this straight.  The U.S. sits around voting on NASA and 
     spotted owls while a maniacal dictator invades every Middle Eastern 
     country and assumes total control of our oil supply?  I THINK NOT!

CROW: Yeah, what did those stupid Arabs ever do for history?

MIKE: Civil war in Bosnia, invasions in Middle East, the possible extinction 
      of the spotted owl... none of these have any "clear effect on the

CROW: I don't dig your authority, man.

*... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...


[SOL.  Mike and the bots are just standing around.  Mike sighs heavily and
 shakes his head.]

TOM: Mike, is there a hell for bad writers?
CROW: If there is, Ratliff's going there.
MIKE: Sure there is, Tom.
CROW: I figure it's probably a hell where you're forced to write for "Barney
      and Friends" or "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers."
MIKE: Not exactly, but close.
TOM: Then what is it, Mike?
MIKE: Well, it's...

[Mike is distracted by the flashing of one of the lights on the counter.]

MIKE: What the-- hey, something's coming in on the Hexfield!

[Everyone turns to see who is on the screen as the Hexfield Viewscreen
 irises open.  It is a nerdish-looking guy in his early twenties.]

MIKE: Um... hello?  Who are you?
STEVE: I am Radford University student and Computer Science major Stephen
       Ratliff, author of the Marrissa Stories and Keeper of the Sacred FAQs
       of alt.startrek.creative!
CROW: Uh oh.  
TOM: Say, Mike... I don't suppose we could somehow train a laser cannon on
     him and blast him out of existence?
MIKE: Tom, you *know* Forrester wouldn't let me make those alterations to
      the SOL like I wanted...
STEVE: Identify yourselves!
MIKE: Huh?  Oh, uh, I'm Mike, this is Tom Servo, and this is Crow T...
STEVE: What are your ranks?
MIKE: Excuse me?
STEVE: Ranks!  Status!  You must have them!
MIKE: Okay... I am Captain Michael J. Nelson of the starship Satellite of
      Love, and this is Lieutenant Servo and Yeoman Crow.  I guess.
STEVE: I see, Captain Mike Nelson of the Satellite of Love.
TOM: Oh, Steve-o... I have a question.
STEVE: What is it, Lieutenant Servo?
TOM: Reading your stories, I am reminded of Dr. Johnson's quote about
     Thomas Sheridan: "Why, sir, Sherry is dull, naturally dull; but it must 
     have taken him a great deal of pains to become what we now see him.  
     Such an excess of stupidity, Sir, is not in Nature."  My question is,
     exactly *how* hard *do* you work to be this bad at the craft of writing?
STEVE: <confused> I don't understand, Lieutenant Servo of the Satellite of
       Love.  Did I mention I'm an Admiral in my Star Trek role-playing group?
TOM: Wonderful.
CROW: Hey, I got another question.  What color is the sky in your little
      world?
TOM: Do you even pay attention to the world around you?
CROW: And what about your "dialogue?"  Have you ever held a real conversation 
      in your life?
TOM: And what's the whole teenage girl obsession about?
MIKE: I have the best question of all: why?  Just WHY??

[Pause.]

STEVE: I think it's time to introduce ourselves again!  Hi, I'm Radford
       University student and Computer Science major Stephen Ratliff, author
       of the...
MIKE: Hey, whoa whoa whoa.  Stop.
STEVE: What?
MIKE: Is that all you do?  You just go around introducing yourself to people?
STEVE: Well... there's also recitations of my accomplishments.
MIKE: Which are...?
STEVE: <nervous> Um... I wrote some stories, and... uh... I have a lot of
       Star Trek stuff...
CROW: Have you ever done anything *really* *important*?  Something that
      *matters*?
STEVE: <long pause, then...> Hi, I'm Radford University student and 
       Computer Science major...

[Mike and the bots turn away from the Hexfield, disgusted.  The Hexfield
Viewscreen irises shut in front of Steve, who is still introducing himself.]

CROW: Yeesh.
TOM: So anyway, Mike, would you finish telling us about Writer's Hell?
MIKE: You really want to know what Writer's Hell is?
TOM&CROW: Yes!
MIKE: Well, it's a very personal hell, where you finally come to know the pain
      your works have wrought on those unfortunate enough to read them.
TOM: And that's where Ratliff's going?
MIKE: Nope.
CROW: What?!
MIKE: He's already there, guys... whether he realizes it or not.

[There is a solemn silence.]

CROW: So... lunch?
TOM: Oh, Crow, you...
CROW: What?  I'm hungry!

[Buzzers and lights, general chaos.]

ALL: AAAAAAH!  FANFIC SIGN!!!

MIKE: Wait a second.  "Star Trek: the TV show" doesn't exist in the Trek

TOM: NO!  I *refuse* to believe that the bunch of overpaid idiots that make

     than the Book of Revelations!  Aside from the fact that most of the 
     events and technologies depicted in Trek are patently *impossible* by 
     the laws of nature, are *you* prepared to proclaim morons like Brannon 
     Braga and Jeri Taylor the second comings of Nostradamus?!

MIKE: Voyager's also been lost in the ratings for three years.
TOM: And Gene Roddenberry's original ideas have been lost for about ten years.

CROW: <Marrissa> Who cares about them?  I wanna know about me, ME, *ME*!

     writing."
CROW: Ego trip's over, Steve.

MIKE: They just *beamed into* the White House, and Clinton the Star Trek fan 
      already knows Wesley Crusher, but he's surprised that there's a starship
      involved?
CROW: I think Ratliff thinks everyone is as dim as he is.
TOM: <British accent> We called him Dim, on account of his being dim.

MIKE: <Marrissa> Of course, *everyone* wants to talk to me.  I'm just so

      I just didn't want to go.

TOM: You tap it, then talk.
CROW: Or you don't tap it, then talk.
MIKE: Or you tap it, and somebody else talks.
TOM: Or you don't tap it to complete a conversation, but the channel is

MIKE: We've never been too clear on how it works, ourselves.

CROW: Um... I really hope there's nothing going on between Wes and Chelsea.
TOM: If there is, my head's going to explode.  That'd be the last straw.

MIKE: Let me get this straight.  They're surrounded by the infinite depths
      of space, capable of bending space itself using their warp drive,
      but they are somehow completely trapped by half of a single starship?
TOM: That's what Ratliff would have you believe.

MIKE: Well, a really big, three-dimensional football field with no boundaries

CROW: For every regulation, there is an equal and opposite plot hole.

MIKE: Child labor statutes, murder laws, the Golden Rule...

CROW: Oh, he was thinking of "Stand By Me."  He really likes that movie.

      certainly be able to find jobs in the suddenly-opened corporate space 
      exploration business!  And even if they couldn't, there's always the 
      cushy government layoff plan to fall back on!  They wouldn't go on 
      *welfare*, fer crying out loud!!
TOM: Nice rant, Crow!  Almost as good as mine!

MIKE: Yeah, as if the average American cares one *iota* about whether NASA 
      is able to conduct further experiments about the mating habits of

TOM: I have a theory about the strawberries.
CROW: Oh, do tell.
TOM: I think strawberries are what gives Marrissa the power to bend reality 
     to her will and dominate the universe.
CROW: Nah.  That power comes from Ratliff's unhealthy fascination with 
      domineering teenage girls.

MIKE: House Minority Whip, Speaker of the House, Electoral College...

TOM: So says Ratliff.  I can't wait until someone in his stories realizes
     that high rank brings responsibility and worry, too.
MIKE: It'll never happen.

CROW: Neither are Ratliff's fanfics, but we have to read them anyway.

     Star Trek videotape collection, and he figures it must be pretty nice.

MIKE: In other words, I threatened to wipe their civilizations out of

[SOL.  Tom and Crow are behind Crow's computer.  Crow is typing.  Mike enters
 and stands behind them.]

MIKE: Okay, explain this plan to me again?
TOM: You know how in today's fanfic Ratliff claims that every Star Trek
     episode, movie, novel, comic book, and work of fanfiction would someday
     come true?
MIKE: Yeah.
TOM: Well, we've decided to use Ratliff's theory against him.  If everything
     he or anybody else writes using the Trek universe comes true, then *we*
     can write a Marrissa story, too!
MIKE: You're writing... a *Marrissa* story?!
TOM: Yeah!  Cool, huh?

[Mike begins edging off to the side.]

MIKE: Um, yeah.  Excuse me while get the chainsaw from underneath my bed...
CROW: Wait, Mike.  It's not what you're thinking.

[Mike stops edging.]

MIKE: It isn't?
CROW: Nope!  See, what *we're* planning to do is put Marrissa through pain
      and torture and suffering and death and stuff.
TOM: Hee hee hee!  We're gonna kill Marrissa!
MIKE: Ah!  I get it!  Can I help?
TOM: Sure!

[Everyone looks to the computer screen.  Crow begins typing.]

CROW: Okay. <typing> "Marrissa vs Soup.  Chapter One."
TOM: Marrissa vs *Soup*??
CROW: Well, why not?  Trust me.
TOM: Okay.
CROW: <typing> "Marrissa entered her quarters on the Stargazer to find a 
      large bowl of soup waiting for her."
TOM: ...and it has a gun and it kills her!
CROW: What?  Soup can't hold a gun!
TOM: Maybe it's really a changeling or something...
CROW: No, it's soup.
TOM: Okay, what about if she trips, hits her head on the bowl, and drowns
     in a puddle of soup?
CROW: She *could* do that, but do you really want to kill her right away?
TOM: YES!!!
CROW: No, we don't!
TOM: No?
CROW: I have a large, intricate plan to make Marrissa suffer.  Slowly at
      first, and then, inch by inch, the torture becomes more and more
      horrible... and *then* she dies.
TOM: How long will this take?
CROW: Well, it might take two or three stories...
TOM: WHAT?!
CROW: Well, there's twists and turns in the plot, and I *really* want to
      make Marrissa suffer for a long time...
TOM: But I want to kill her *now*!!
MIKE: Uh... I hate to interrupt, here, but... can we get on with it?
CROW: Fine.  I shall continue.  <typing> "Marrissa wondered how the soup
      could have gotten into her quarters -- she always left the door
      locked.  Nervously, she dipped a finger into the soup and tasted it..."
TOM: ...and the soup was poisoned, so she died!
CROW: <angrily> TOM!!!

 flashing lights go off.]

CROW: Let's see. Senators vote to cut expenditures on a bloated, corrupt, and

MIKE: It's Ratliff's world, Crow; his sky is green, his sun is purple, and 
      the electorate are complete poltroons.

CROW: Convoluted or no, I can see why they might try it.

CROW: Oh, you mean like "draining the lizard?"
TOM: "Taking the old boy out for a walk?"
CROW: "Going to see a man about a horse?"
TOM: "Shaking hands with the legend?"

CROW: Those Publisher's Clearinghouse people are *very* thorough.

MIKE: <manager> I just assumed they were doing some kind of weird sex-shul

TOM: <Ross> And, by the way, I'm not a stranger from the 24th century with

CROW: <manager> On a first date?  What kind of man do you think I am?

>         "Room 104 is this way gentlemen," the manager said.
>         They approached the room and knocked on the door, "Open up,

MIKE: <quietly> Psst-- sir, *we're* the FBI.

TOM: Naked, except for a leather bikini.

CROW: Does that make Ross Mr. Stanley?

ALL: <pause>
TOM: Okay, I don't like him anymore.
MIKE: Now I *hope* he's caught.  He deserves to be arrested just for

TOM: Arrested?  He deserves the *Chair*!

TOM: Maybe you should have picked less-obvious pseudonyms.
MIKE: And a less-stupid plan for destroying Starfleet.  After all, you only

TOM: She's going to vaporize Washington from orbit.  It's the only way

MIKE: You need to cover your tracks more, so you're going to make a piece of

CROW: She's looking for Waldo.

MIKE: How very hip of you.

> "I intend to surround the Eagle and board it.  

TOM: Is it possible to surround something with two objects?
CROW: Only if the two objects are Rush Limbaugh and Roseanne.

> As you can see, I've got the helm.  

MIKE: No, that was Dean Martin.

MIKE: An engineless disk called the "  ".

CROW: Not to mention silly and pointless.
MIKE: Well, see, in space nobody knows you're there if you don't have your 
      lights on.  That's how the Romulan cloaking device works -- they just 
      turn off their lights.
TOM: <Chief Wiggum> Oooooh... ghost ship... valley's full of them.

      going to be elected Queen of Starfleet, and then I'll take over the 
      Klingon empire once Gowron sees how cool I am, and then we'll go wipe 
      out those stinky Cardassians and those poopy Dominion people, and I'll 
      be Queen of the Universe!
MIKE: Crow, you just outlined the plots of the next five Marrissa stories.
CROW: D'oh!

>         "Yes, the other vessels are, in fact you might say they are a

TOM: You might also say this fanfic sucks and Ratliff should be strapped to
     the Tree of Despair and have his liver picked out by vultures and...

>         "Scotty here, lassie."

MIKE: <Marrissa> Admiral Scott, please take that bottle of Manishewitz out of 
      your mouth when you're speaking to me.

>         "Admiral, how would you like to command a Constitution class
> starship again," Marrissa inquired.  

CROW: <Scotty> I never commanded one, ye little twerp!

> "I'm rather short on command staff."

TOM: Not to mention intelligence, patience, mercy, or human warmth.
MIKE: <Marrissa> I don't understand it... people seem almost reluctant to 
      work under me.

>         "As long as it's not permanent, lassie," Scotty said.  

CROW: Scotty's been burned by home body waves before.

> "I'd enjoy seeing if I can get one back in shape."

TOM: "In shape," of course, being a phrase that Scotty's never been that 
     familiar with.

>         "Then, pick some crew and take the Eagle for me," Marrissa said.
> "Lieutenant Crusher has the equations for your return to the correct

MIKE: <Scotty> Wesley did the equations?  We're doomed...

CROW: <irritated> What?

>         "Lieutenant Crusher, how may I help you Princess?"
>         "Don't call me Princess brother, 

TOM: <Wes> Can I call you Earl Daddy?

>                                         and tell me that you have those

MIKE: <Marrissa> Don't call me a monarch, but obey my every command.

>         "I have them ready, Duchess," Wes replied.

CROW: <weak laughter, then...> Kill him!
TOM: Kill *me*...

>         "Don't call me that either," Marrissa stated.  

MIKE: <Marrissa> In fact, don't call me at all.

> "My chief

CROW: As... you... wish...!

>         "Aye, Aye, Risa, Lieutenant Crusher out."

TOM: Risa?  The Nookie Planet?  Where?

>         "Sometimes, I think brothers are more trouble than their worth,"

MIKE: I *knew* I'd encountered this unique brand of comedic wit before. 
      Ratliff writes for "Blossom," doesn't he?

CROW: <Marrissa> But they're so tasty!

MIKE: <Ross> Uh, pay no mind to that almond smell...

TOM: Gotta love that Starfleet spirit.
CROW: That about sums up my feelings for any disfiguring disease Ratliff 
      should ever suffer from.

>         "Ross, you are senior staff now," Marrissa said.  "Have you ever

MIKE: Only those that realize children shouldn't be Starfleet officers.

>         "No, but, your not on the Enterprise now," Ross said.  

CROW: Quintessential Shatner punctuation there...
TOM: No!  But!  You're... not on the!  Enterprise!  Now!

MIKE: So toss her out the airlock and let's find out.

TOM: <Sisko> Never heard of that ship before.

MIKE: Where does she pick these guys up?  I need to have a talk with her.

MIKE: Ho hum, the excesses of power.

CROW: Oh, what's he gonna do - throw an empty bottle of Thunderbird at me?

> "Or maybe I would as it's twenty years younger than him."

TOM: Marrissa, honey, the Rosetta Stone is twenty years younger than Doohan.

>         "Admiral Scott's on board?" Sisko said.  

MIKE: Yeah - all 350 pounds of him.
TOM: <Dangerfield> I won't say Doohan is fat, but when he flies near a

MIKE: I'm sure he'd be glad to tell you where to go, honey, but I don't 
      think docking is what he'd have in mind.

TOM: Next on Monty Pylon's Flying Circus, a fanfic writer with three buttocks.

CROW: Yeah, I have a hot date with a phaser tonight.

[Mike and the bots leave the theater.]


*... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 


[SOL.  Crow is breathing deeply, attempting to cleanse himself of the
 fanfic.  Mike is rubbing his temples and grimacing.  Tom is shaking his
 head back and forth, softly mumbling, "aggida aggida aggida..."]

ALL: *WHEW*...

[Everyone stops their attempts to recover from the fanfic.]

MIKE: Yet *another* Ratliff fanfic down the drain, eh, fellas?
TOM: This was, what, Ratliff fanfic number seven for us?  Eight, maybe?
CROW: Yeah, and only about 20 billion more to go.
TOM: Shut up, Crow.  
CROW: For the record, I would like to point out that "Time Speeder" is,
      without a doubt, the single WORST story Ratliff has EVER WRITTEN!!
TOM: No argument here.
MIKE: You know, something else occured to me during this fanfic...
CROW: You mean *besides* thoughts of suicide?
MIKE: Yeah.  I figured that Ratliff's Trek universe must be completely
      separate from the *real* Trek universe.  Aside from the fact that
      Starfleet would never in its right mind promote a 15-year-old to
      Second Officer, the clincher for me was the existence of the TV show
      "Star Trek" in Ratliff's universe.  The Trek franchise doesn't exist 
      in the Trek universe.  Otherwise, Kirk would have been recognized
      immediately and torn apart by crazed Trekkies when he went back to
      1986 San Fransisco in "Star Trek IV."

[There is a pause.]

CROW: So what?
MIKE: Well, okay, so it's no flash of divine inspiration.  It's just
      something I noticed.

[Another pause.  Everyone sighs.]

TOM: Hmmm... so if Ratliff's universe isn't the Trek universe, then what
     is it?  Could it be *our* universe?
CROW: Hell no!  There are even *more* differences between Ratliff's 
      reality and *our* reality!
MIKE: Take NASA, for example.  In real life, NASA is a bloated, inefficient
      mess that never quite recovered from Kennedy's push for a moon-shot
      ahead of schedule so that he could gain popularity and political
      prestige.  But in Ratliff's reality, NASA employs *millions*, and is
      an inspiration to more!
CROW: Is that really true?  About Kennedy?
MIKE: I think so.  That's what I heard, anyway.
CROW: Huh!
TOM: Don't stop there!  How about Bill Clinton?  In real life, Clinton is
     an adulterer, a draft-dodger, and a crook.
MIKE: Allegedly.
TOM: Um... yeah.  But in Ratliff's reality, Bill's a single father, a 
     Trekkie, and a genuine nice guy!
CROW: In real life, 15-year-olds can't even *drive*, at least not in this
      country.  But in Ratliff's reality, 15-year-olds can command starships 
      better than experienced officers who spent *years* in Starfleet Academy 
      and ascending the command structure.
MIKE: In real life, there are statutory rape laws to protect young girls --
      like Chelsea Clinton -- from the advances of older men -- like
      Wesley Crusher.
TOM: And in Ratliff's reality?
MIKE: Hey, no problem!
CROW: Yep.
TOM: In real life, Star Trek is a bloated franchise that started out with
     good intentions, but has become a souless, money-making machine.  But
     in Ratliff's reality, Trek is the BOOK OF FRIGGIN' *REVELATIONS*!!!
MIKE: There's one more difference that *really* sets off our two realities.
CROW: What's that?
MIKE: In real life, writers must not *only* use a spellchecker, but also
      read and re-read their stories several times, taking great care to
      make sure their art reflects well on them.  But in Ratliff's reality,
      well...
TOM: 'Nuff said.
MIKE: So, basically, Ratliff's universe is completely separate and distinct
      reality from both Star Trek *and* us.  Ratliffland is a universe unto
      itself.
CROW: A truly stinky universe that no one in their right minds would even
      *think* about visiting.
MIKE: <to Cambot> What do you think, sirs?

[Deep 13.  There are piles upon piles of videotapes in the lab.  Forrester
