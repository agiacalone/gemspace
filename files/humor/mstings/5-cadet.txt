[Open on the Satellite of Love. The lighting is darkened a bit and for
some inexplicable reason there's a piano off to the side, and various
mugs and glasses and pizza boxes on the table. Crow and Tom are leaning
against the piano; Crow has a mug of beer in one hand. In the back of
the room is a big poster-sized photograph of Michael O'Donoghue.]

TOM: I sang for you... don't I get a Least Loved Bedtime Story?

CROW: No, you don't.

TOM: What? But... why, Mr. Mike?

CROW: Because you sang bad, kid.

TOM: [suddenly blubbering] Oh, God, I'm going to miss that man! Why did
     he have to die?

CROW: [also blubbering] Why couldn't they have taken me in-
      stea-a-a-a-d!...

[Enter Mike. He's wearing a jet black jumpsuit and a black top hat.]

MIKE: Hi everyone. Welcome to the Satellite of Love. News is a bit slow
      up here... we just got the report about Michael O'Donoghue's
      death. Y'know, "Mr. Mike" on Saturday Night Live, writer during
      the show's golden age, the whole deal. While Voltaire and P. G.
      Wodehouse deserve mentioning, Michael O'Donoghue is regarded by
      many as godfather of the bitingly sarcastic remark.

TOM: Death be not proud, for you have taken from us a great man! [con-
     tinues blubbering]

MIKE: Come on, you two. We have to do our bit here. Anyway, Mr. O'Dono-
      ghue was something of an inspiration to us all and we wanted to do
      a little something... You guys ready?

TOM and CROW: [calming down] We're ready.

GYPSY: [entering] Ready! Live, 1994 prime-time season, with nine-inch
       knitting needles jammed into their eyes.

[All bow their heads for a moment, then:]

TOM: AAAAAAUGH!

CROW: AAAAH! AAAAGH! AAAAGH!

GYPSY: AAAAIEEE!!!

MIKE: AAAAUGH! AAAAH!!

[Rushing around, absolute chaos and screams, ending with everyone col-
lapsed behind the desk. Commercial Sign flashes, and Mike's hand reaches
up weakly to press it.]


[Looking for MST3K: The Movie trailers? Surely you jest. It took us here
at Comedy Central three years to kill off this show, and we're not going
to start promoting it now!]


[SOL. All 'bots are here and Mike is back in his normal green jumpsuit.]

MIKE: Good job, you guys. You really got into your characters.

TOM: I think I portrayed Adam Sandler brilliantly.

CROW: I have dibs on Kevin Nealon.

[The Mads' light starts flashing.]

GYPSY: Oh, look, Shasti and Dierdre are calling.

MIKE: What's happening, sirs?

[Cut to Deep 13. Dr. Clayton Forrester is there, looking vaguely ner-
vous. The place is rather more nicely cleaned up than usual, and there
is no sign of Frank anywhere.]

DR. F: Hello, Kevin Sleet. I'm afraid we're going to have to skip the
       pleasantries and the invention exchange today...

[SOL Bridge. Mike is holding up a big ugly piece of machinery with se-
veral large playing cards attached to various components.]

MIKE: But what about my five-speed dual-overhead-cam pinochle deck?

[Deep 13]

DR. F: You'll just have to save it for next time, because... [in a theat-
       rical whisper] I'm being audited! [normal voice] Ever since the
       Gizmonic Institute and I-- uh-- went our seperate ways, I've been
       getting funding under a grant from the American Association for
       the Advancement of Mad Science. They're rather more strict than
       Gizmonics was, I'm afraid... so for the good of the many it's go-
       ing to be necessary to, ah, sweep a few things under the rug, as
       it were.

[SOL Bridge]

CROW: [suspiciously] Where's Frank?

[Deep 13]

DR. F: [unconvincingly] Oh, around.

[There is a loud hollow thump on the wall.]

FRANK (offscreen): Doctor, how long do I have to stay in the reactor
                   core? My hair's falling out in *clumps* now!

DR. F: *Quiet*, Frank, or I'll take away your dental coverage.

FRANK: I'll be quiet.

DR. F: As I was saying... for a number of very good reasons I don't
       think the AAAMS needs to know about our little movie project.
       They get so antsy when you don't spend *every penny* of a grant
       *exactly* the way you're supposed to.

[SOL Bridge]

TOM: Let me get this straight-- you've been embezzling money to keep
     the Satellite of Love in operation?

CROW: Money that was given to you in the name of advancing pure science?
      For shame!

MIKE: Yeah, that's pretty low, even for you, Dr. Forrester.

[Deep 13]

DR. F: Oh, "embezzlement" is such a loaded term! I prefer to think of it
       as... redistribution of wealth. Ah-heh.

[The doorbell chimes.]

DR. F: Oh, dear. The auditor's here. Now remember kiddies, not a word to
       let the auditor know you're around. But I wouldn't want you to be
       bored-- and making trouble-- so just to keep you busy, I'm sen-
       ding you "Cadet Cruise", the latest toxic spill by Stephen Rat-
       liff--

[SOL Bridge]

ALL: AAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!!

CROW: I'd rather have the knitting needles!

[Deep 13]

DR. F: [affecting surprise] Oh, you *are* familiar with his work, aren't
       you? Well, this sequel lives down to its predecessors.

[The doorbell chimes again.]

DR. F: [hastily] Eat Ratliff, Adam Warren. [He pushes the button and then
       hurries to the huge hatchway at the back of the set.] Coming!

[He spins the handle and opens the hatchway.]

DR. F: [at his most ingratiating] Ahh, Doctor... Emily... Crichton!
       Isn't it? Please, do come in!

[Enter Doctor Emily Crichton (who bears a striking resemblance to Nu-
veena), a tall black-haired woman carrying a clipboard. She's wearing a
lime green lab coat with tie-dye stylings that make it look much cooler
than Dr. Forrester's. On the chest of the coat is a Deep 13-style patch
that says AAAMS - AUDITING DIVISION below a little icon of a dollar sign
with wings.]

DR. F: Sorry about the delay-- those Nobel people will talk your ear
       off.

DR. C: [clearly uninterested] Can it, Forrester. You may as well know
       this is a formality. The Association has already decided to boot
       your sorry ass out. But since I'm here, you may as well start the
       tour and show me what you wasted all that grant money on.

DR. F: Ah... oh, dear.

[SOL Bridge. Alarms, buzzers, et cetera go off...]

MIKE: We've got fanfic siiiiiiign!

CROW: [as Saavik] Moonlighting. Starfleet admirals get paid $5.50 an
      hour.
TOM: [as Picard] And what's a nursery doing in a warship, anyway?

> END SECTION 1 of Cadet Cruise

ALL: Yaaaaay!

> SECTION 2 FOLLOWS

CROW: Booooooo!
TOM: [sobbing] Nooo!!
MIKE: I think we can slip out during the intermission. Let's go.

[They leave the theater.]

...6...5...4...3...2...1...*...

[Bridge of the SOL.]

TOM: [weeping] Mike, I can't _take_ this any more! "A Versus D", "Better
     The Devil You Know", "Treklander", that Rocky Horror thing, and now
     Cadet Cruise-- these fanfics have been getting worse and worse and 
     *worse*!

CROW: He's fragile. You've gotta be careful with him.

MIKE: No, I think Tom's right, Crow. I know the bad movies and bad writ-
      ing are part of the deal, but enough is enough.

CROW: It's not *that* bad. You need some perspective. It's just a fan-
      fic, you both should really just--

TOM: [leans over, whispering very quietly in Crow's ear] "CONTINUED:"

CROW: AAAAAAGH!!

[Crow runs screaming from the room.]

MIKE: Normally, Tom, you'd get a demerit for that, but I think in this
      case an object lesson was called for.

[Enter Gypsy.]

MIKE: Oh, hi Gyps.

GYPSY: What's all the hubbub... bub?

TOM: [with a mad gleam in his... er... dome] The hubbub is we're getting
     out of here. No more John_-_Winston, no more John F. Moore, and
     *especially* no more Stephen Ratliff.

MIKE: We've been through this, Tom. There's no way off the Satellite. No
      shuttles, no transporters, not even any escape pods.

TOM: Well, did you *count* them??

MIKE: Twice.

TOM: Grr.

[Pause.]

TOM: Wait a minute. It's crazy, but it just might work... that's *it*!!
     That's how we're getting out of here!

MIKE: What?

TOM: Cambot! Turn on the communications link to Deep 13!

[Cut to Deep 13. Dr. Crichton is leaning over and inspecting some equip-
ment along one wall, making disparaging-looking checks on her clipboard.
Dr. Forrester is standing right behind her to one side, peering over her
shoulder and trying to see what she's looking at. She turns and gives
him a killing glare; he backs off hastily with a sickly smile on his
face.]

[Cut back to the SOL. Crow has returned as well, slightly dizzy.]

CROW: [dazedly] I'm all better now. I took all the red ones. What's hap-
      pening?

TOM: We're going to let that auditor person know about the Satellite of
     Love! You heard what Dr. Forrester said-- if she finds out about
     it, she'll shut him down! And we'll be free!

CROW: Neat.

[They all start shouting at the communications link...]

CROW: Hey! Ms... uh... Auditor!

MIKE: Dr. Crichton!

TOM: Over here!

[Cut to Deep 13. For a few moments the SOL crew are still audible shout-
ing, but they quickly stop as it becomes apparent that Drs. Forrester
and Crichton can't hear them.]

DR. C: That reactor is shielded. Very poor technique. It should be pour-
       ing radiation into the environment, and instead you've sealed it
       up so it's [looks disgusted] *safe*.

DR. F: [haplessly] It was like that when we moved in.

DR. C: And there was this weird banging noise and faint cries for help.
       What was that all about?

DR. F: Oh, just the wind.

DR. C: [suspiciously] You're not keeping anyone in that reactor core,
       are you, Doctor Forrester?

DR. F: Oh, no! Of course not!

DR. C: I see. Too bad. That'd at least be worth some style points. [She
       makes another checkmark on the clipboard.] Now when was the last
       time you tried to take over the world?

DR. F: Well... I've been so *busy*... what with one thing and another,
       I...

[Cut to SOL Bridge.]

CROW: [distraught] She can't hear us! [normal voice] And she's so cute,
      too! [distraught again] This is torture!

TOM: Dr. Forrester must have set up some kind of diabolically clever
     anti-demodulating force ray, or a sonic cancellation cone or some-
     thing to prevent us from being heard!

GYPSY: Actually, he just turned the volume down on his TV set.

[All pause.]

MIKE: Hey... Gypsy... do you know how all of Dr. F's equipment works?

GYPSY: Sure! When they wired up the Umbilicus I got access to all the
       systems.

MIKE: Can you set off an alarm or something and attract attention in
      Deep 13?

GYPSY: Um, okay...

TOM: Goodgoodgood! Do it now!

GYPSY: It'll take me a while, though.

TOM: A "while"?! What are we supposed to do in the meantime?!

[Buzzers, alarms, lights, all go off.]

MIKE: We've got fanfic siiiiiign!

TOM: Aaaahhh! I was speaking RHETORICALLY...

[General chaos.]

TOM: Okay, let's start at the top here. First, what facilities does a
     warship full of defectors that's just been disabled have to change
     its markings? How do they know about Pontiac? *Why* Pontiac? And
     how can they be finished in five minutes?
MIKE: You're very calm about all this...

MIKE: But, that's life for a daughter of two redshirts.

CROW: What's with the numbers?
TOM: I am not a number, I am a free man!

[SOL Bridge. The lights are flashing and a number of unobtrusive buzzers
and things are sounding.]

MIKE: Are we all set, Gypsy?

GYPSY: Communications systems ready!

MIKE: Make it so!

TOM: Did you have to say that, Nelson? It gives me flashbacks. [He shud-
     ders]

[Cut to Deep 13.]

DR. C: [disbelieving] So to sum up, you misappropriated thirty million
       dollars in grants and spent them on...

DR. F: [reluctantly] Hamdingers.

DR. C: Hamdingers. Yuck. Now, Fluffernutter, I could understand, but...
       Frankly, Forrester, I was ready to be disappointed, but the word
       "disappointment" no longer seems strong enough. I hope you have
       your resume updated, because--

[Alarms and buzzers similar to Movie Sign on the Satellite of Love start
going off in Deep 13.]

DR. C: [staring around wildly] What the hell is *that*?

DR. F: [weakly] Ah... the microwave burritos must be done?

DR. C: It's coming from over there.

[She advances on the Tektronic console, coming right up to the camera.]

DR. F: That's it. I'm done for.

DR. C: [pointing] What's with that guy and those cute robots? [taps the
       console, then reaches over as if turning up a volume knob] Hello?
       Can you hear me?

[SOL Bridge. We just see a closeup of Crow.]

CROW: Hi!

[Deep 13]

DR. C: [bemusedly] Hi.

[SOL]

CROW: [suavely] So, Doctor Crichton. You're not, ah, seeing anyone, are
      you?

MIKE: Crow!!

[Mike elbows him out of the way. Cambot pulls back to the usual view-
point. Mike, Tom, and Gypsy are visible.]

MIKE: Doctor, my name is Mike Nelson. I was just a temp and I was kid-
      napped by Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank and shot into space com-
      pletely against my will!

TOM: And they've kept us stuck up here for years! The air is stale, the
     food is bad and our cable TV only picks up TNN, three home shopping
     networks, CBN and VH-1!

MIKE: And worst of all, they make us watch cheesy movies! The worst they
      can find!

GYPSY: In the name of humanity you've gotta shut him down and bring us
       back to Earth!

[Deep 13. Dr. C looks astonished. In the background Dr. F looks furious.
His expression falls apart as Dr. C turns to look at him.]

DR. C: Dr. Forrester. Is this true?

DR. F: [suddenly] Yes! I admit it! It's all true! All of it! [shame-
       facedly] This project is where all that embezzled money went to.

DR. C: [still shellshocked] I suppose running a satellite that big must
       be expensive.

DR. F: No, actually operations costs are very reasonable. But getting
       the rights for the bad movies, now that's *murder*. [distraught]
       Anyway, you've heard the entire story now. Shut me down. It's on-
       ly what I deserve.

DR. C: Shut you down? [chuckling] Why, Dr. Forrester, this is the most
       impressive project I've seen all year!

DR. F: What?

DR. C: Shutting it down would be a disaster for humanity. Think of all
       the civilian applications your technology has!

DR. F: [still not quite believing this] Oh, yeah! Like... ah...

DR. C: ...Well...

DR. F: ...Er...

DR. C: ...Well, bunches of civilian applications.

DR. F: Right, right. Just tons.

DR. C: I can't imagine why the grants committee ever rejected it in the
       first place, but rest assured I'll get that straightened out. I
       think I can even get an increase in funds for you to pay for
       those movie rights. [admiringly] Here I thought you'd been just
       wasting time, but you've gotten more evil and insanity accom-
       plished in the last two years than a lot of those drones on the
       committee have done in their entire lives.

DR. F: [modestly] I do my best.

[Dr. Crichton makes a few notations on her clipboard...]

DR. C: It's been a pleasure, Doctor. We need more mad scientists like
       you. Keep up the good work. If I may, I'd like to observe one or
       two experiments in the future...?

DR. F: Why, that would be fine, Doctor. I'll just let my assistant out
       of the reactor core, we'll go over the schedule and get back to
       you.

DR. C: Sounds marvelous.

[They shake hands warmly and he shows her out. Dr. F pauses at the door
a few moments, then turns around, marches right up to the camera, thumbs
his nose at it and pushes The Button.]

TOM: You know... irony can be really ironic sometimes.
MIKE: You know... life really *bites* sometimes.
TOM: Good point.
CROW: I still say she was cute, though.
TOM & MIKE: Shut up, Crow.
