Subject: MiSTing: Who Q? Where Q? [1/8]

Just another MiSTing by me. Comments are welcome. Chris Mayfield,
camfield@iastate.edu

[General opening antics]

[1...2...3...4...5...6...]

[SOL. Mike is sitting with his head in his hands, elbows propped up on
the desk. Crow and Tom have had their arms placed in similar positions.
They all look very bummed.]

All: [sigh]

[Gypsy comes on.]

Gypsy: What's wrong with you guys?

Crow: Dr. Forrester told us that he'd be sending us another Ratliff
 fanfic.

Mike and Tom: [sigh]

Gypsy: Come on! You guys have faced worse!

Tom: But this is _Ratliff!_

Mike and Crow: [sigh]

Gypsy: What you guys need is a laugh! Ok--let's see...a priest, a
 parson, and a rabbi--um, no...two guys walk into a bar...wait...I know!
 What did the big can of beans say to the little can of beans? [pause]
 Nothing! Beans can't talk!

[Gypsy looks expectantly at Mike, Tom, and Crow who sit there looking
miserable. After a couple seconds of no reaction, she lowers her head to
the desk.]

Gypsy: [sighs]

[light flashes]

[Commercials]

[SOL. Everyone is lined up head to head to head to head.]

Gypsy: [sighs]

Mike: [sighs]

Tom: [sighs]

Crow: Bud.

Tom: Weis.

Crow: Bud.

Tom: Weis.

[light flashes]

Mike: Knock it off, you two. The Scarecrow and Mrs. King are calling.

[Deep 13. Clayton is gloating. Mrs. Forrester is in the background,
knitting a wool noose.]

Dr. F: Ah, Nelson. You knew it was coming, didn't you? Well, now it's
 here! And there's no escape! [laughs maniacally]

Mrs. F: [looks up] Clay, what are you laughing about now? You haven't
 been chewing lead chips again, have you?

Dr. F: [annoyed] No, _mother._ I haven't done that since _college._ I'm
 a grown man _now._ You don't always--

Mrs. F: [looking at the screen] What is this? Some sort of text
 adventure? Is this one of those MUFs or MAPs or something? [shocked]
 You're not having cybersex are you?

Dr. F: [under his breath] I wish...

Mrs. F: What was that?

Dr. F: Uh...I said I wish...to show you my latest experiment. It's
 called a MiSTing. It's a text version of my regular experiments. Right
 now I was getting ready to send them a Ratliff fanfic when--

Mrs. F: [standing up] Ratliff? _Stephen_ Ratliff?

Dr. F: [shocked] You've heard of him?

Mrs. F: Of course I've heard of him! Wherever discussions of pain and
 misery are, there'll be talk of Ratliff. I've read some of his fiction
 in Evil Reader's Digest. Clayton, I had no idea you worked with such a
 pillar of malificence!

Dr. F: [rather proud] Well, you know...what can I say?

Mrs. F: So, what is it? Enterprized? A Gul's Revenge?

Dr. F: Who Q? Where Q?

Mrs. F: I don't believe I've read that one.

Dr. F: Don't worry, mom. Just watch the monitor. As for you, Nelson,
 here it is, steaming hot from Ratliff's Web page. Bite down hard.
 [pushes the button]

[SOL. Chaos.]

All: We've got fanfic sign!

[6...5...4...3...2...1...]

>Who Q? Where Q?

Crow: I put up with Ratliff putting Marrissa in charge of the Enterprise
 saucer section, having her outsmart all the grownups, and being
 promoted to whatever, but if Ratliff makes her one of the Q continuum,
 I quit.

All: _Her?_
Tom: I've heard about revisionism, but...

All: To lamely go where everyone has already trampled to death.

>               to boldly go where no one has gone before.
>        At least that is what the Enterprise is suppose to be doing.

Tom: But with Ratliff writing, who knows what'll happen.

>Lately all the new life the Enterprise has seen is Nurse Ogawa's

Mike: Aren't all civilizations pretty much centuries old? I mean, you
 don't find "new" ones, just meet old ones for the first time.

>As for going were no one has gone before,

Tom: [Marrissa] Been there, seen that, done it.

>                                          the Enterprise hasn't done

Mike: Ever since we got canceled.

>                      But then again a twelve and a half year old
>doesn't usually command a diplomatic mission either.

All: [weeping and gnashing of teeth]
Tom: God, please smite me now.

>        That suprizes you doesn't it?

Crow: It really shouldn't. After all, we knew it was a Stephen "Plot
 Contrivance" Ratliff story.

Mike: [Marrissa] I'll be your guide to Hell for the following hour and a
 half.

Mike: I klepped out of Psych 101 and English 104.

>        In fact I was completing 3 of those hours; Tactics 360,
>Diplomatic Negotiation;

Tom: Ah, yes, Tactics 360: being able to twist the words of your enemies
 around until no one can tell what they really meant.

All: [singing] Iiiiiiii want to knoooooow...
Tom: I want to know about interesting character development.
Mike: Not in this fanfic.
Crow: I want to know about realistic dialogue.
Mike: Uh-uh. Not here.
Tom: I want to know about lame storylines, static characters, and
 unbelievable plot evolution.
Mike: Anyone else?
Bots: NO!
Mike: Oh well. You're going to get it anyway.

>        "Aye, sir," Patterson replied.

Crow: But by that time, all the jelly donuts were gone.

 24th century.

>       as she reported, "Engineering is staffed.  Shayna and I chould
>find no engineering reason for the disappearances- yet."

Mike: Insert ominous chord here.

>        Jay Gordon, the first officer, arrived in the red and blue
>command uniform.

Crow: Dressed for duty or disaster, Jay Gordon knows the importance of
 fashion. Our first officer is sporting a hot little red and blue number
 that says, "I'm a kid, but _I'm_ the boss."

>                  "Duty schedule is posted," he said.  "Alpha shift is
>reporting for duty.  I have assigned people to take care of the younger

Tom: [Marrissa] But who's going to fed _us?!_
Mike: It's Jim Henson's Donner Party Babies.

Crow: Where's Spunky?
Mike: I fed him to Alexander.

Tom: Gee, thanks, and I didn't get you anything.

Crow: Which isn't a whole heck of a lot.

>                    is that the computer tells me that I am the only
>officer left," Marrissa responded.  "Engineering problems have been
>ruled out though."

Crow: How much thought did that take?
Tom: [dumb voice] Duh, do warp core breaches only affect adults?

>        "What happened?"
>        "The adult crew has dissappeared,"

Mike: And none of them have sent child support.

>                                           Marrissa said.  "No one over
>the age of 18 is left on board.

Crow: [Marrissa] Billy has a navigator's permit, but we need someone
 over the age of twenty one to ride up front.

>                                 We have no medical crew, a slim
>security staff, but elsewere we have sufficant staff."

Tom: So a crew of 76, only 56 which can actually _do_ anything, none of
 whom have _any_ experience, are able to run the largest, most advanced,
 most complicated ship in Starfleet? I DON'T THINK SO!

>        "Just how much do you know about the Naklab Situation?" Admiral
>Okie asked, curious.

Crow: [Okie] Forget about the disappearance of 1400 senior staff
 members; I want to get your view on current events.

>        "The Naklab system has four inhabited class M planets, Bresa,
>Troac, Nevolsia, and Sobnia,"

Tom: Oh, it's a Junior Jumble.
Crow: Serb(i)a, Cro(a)t(i)a, Slovenia, and Bosnia. And it spells out:
 Aii!
Mike: Which is just how we feel.

>                              Marrissa said.  "They were colonized by
>people from the Balkan area on Earth.

Mike: Who just happened to love anagrams.

>                                       The current situation involves
>everyone but Nevolsia.

Crow: You guys go ahead. I'll just sit this war out.

>                        Bres and Troac both claim Sobnia.  Sobnia has
>declared independence.  The Bres have Sobnia's capital under seige.

Mike: With Steven Seagal!!

>The only thing that is keeping this tinderbox

Tom: I think the correct phrase is "powderkeg."

>                                              from erupting in flames
>is the promise from all sides that they will not open or advance
>hositilites during negoitation."

Mike: Plus we promised that if they were all good they could stay up and
 watch Letterman.

>        "You keep well informed," Okie said.  "Your Captain was to be
>the thirteenth mediator we sent.

Crow: Nothing ominous in that.

>                                  All previous medaitors either gave up
>or left in a box.

Tom: I've had a grudge against Picard for years! I was finally going to
 get rid of him! And I would have succeeded if it hadn't been for you
 pesky kids!

>                   Only the promise that we would send Captain Picard
>of the Enterprise kept them from resuming hostilites this time.  Now it
>looks like the children in the tinderbox have found the matches."

Crow: Heh, heh. Fire. Cool.
Mike: Stop that, or I'll use those "special parts" to fix the garbage
 disposal.

>        "Perhaps not," Marrissa tentatively suggested.
>        "Of coarse it's a complete diasaster,"

Tom: What? The spelling?

>                                               Okie said.  "Something
>causes the flagship of the fleet to lose its captain leaving his
>daugher Marrissa Pic-ard ...

Crow: Pic-any card...

>                              Wait a minute here,

Mike: I've just had an incredibly stupid idea!

>say I was sending Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  Marrissa Amber Picard, you
>are here by promoted to the field commission of Captain.

Crow: I wanna be there when they court-martial this guy for stupidity
 above and beyond the call of duty.

Mike: Or you leave in a box.

Mike: And which Lawrence brother you think is the cutest.

Crow: Joey!

>        "I'm Jay Gordon, acting Leiutenant Commander, and First
>Officer," the 10 year old boy beside Marrissa said.

Tom: Matt!

>        Then next to him a 10 year old with long black hair piped up,
>"I'm Clara Sutter, acting Leiutenant, Second Officer and Cheif
>Engineer."

Crow: Andy!

>        Beside her a 7 year old boy spoke up, "Patterson Supra, acting
>Leiutenant, and Cheif of Security."

Mike: D.H!
Bots: Huh?

>        Across from her was a red-headed teenager said, "Heather
>Cowhig, Conn Officer, Cadet."

Tom: Here at the Miracle Mile, we have the world's largest selection of
 cadets, portlies, double knits...
Crow: Eddie, are you kidding?

>        Beside her a Klingon spoke up, "Alexander, acting

Mike: Oh, I don't know about that.

>        Then the Doctor spoke up, "Doctor Jackson Johnson, Cheif
>Medical Officer, full Leiutenant."

Mike: So there. Nyah.

>        "Now that everyone knows who is what, lets get down to
>business,"  Marrissa said.

Tom: [Marrissa] Third quarter profits are down and I want to know why!

>                            "For the most part this mission will be
>easy.

Crow: Try not to die.

>       With the exception of Security, Medical and myself.

Mike: And the rest of the sentence.

>                                                            We are

Tom: We're going to kiss Sobnia and make it all better.

Crow: YES!! Finally a glimmer of light amidst the impenetrable gloom!

>        "The're despurt alright," Marrissa replied.  "Jay will you
>update us on our personal problem."

All: [clear throats]
Mike: [Jay] I told you not to bring up our "personal problem" in public.

Tom: You don't suppose a that base might have some personnel more
 capable of running a starship than a bunch of kids, do you?

>        "I don't think Mr Sonak has that many doctors and nurses
>available," Docto Johnson said.

Crow: No, they just happen to have an entire medical fleet available.

>        "He does," Marrissa said. "They are waiting for the newly
>commissioned Galaxy class starship Independence and the Medical ship
>Nightengale.  Which won't arrive for a week and a month respectively.

Crow: Doh! I should have guessed!
Tom: But if it won't arrive for a month, then what are they doing on
 some backwater planet waiting around?
Mike: Just because it's the 24th century doesn't mean they're efficient.

>Now on to the disappearance of the regular adult members of this crew,
>Patterson."

Tom: [Patterson] All we found was "Croatoa" carved into a bulkhead.

>        "Visual Logs indicate that the crew disappeared in individual
>flashes of light,"

Mike: Spontaneous combustion!

>                   the young boy responded.  "The transfer of command

>incates lots of power was used."

Crow: Could you be a little more vague?

>        "Explainations?" Marrissa asked.  "Engineering?" Clara nodded
>negatively.

Mike: [nodding] Yes it's not.

>             "Any possiblities?"
>        "Possible," Clara suddenly spoke up.  "Computer run a

>        "There is a 95.637% correlation," the computer responded.

Tom: It's close enough for significance.

>        "Any other possiblities," Marrissa asked. When no one spoke up
>she continued, "Then we will move on to shift command assignments.  As

Mike: Jay's shift is the alpha and omega.

Crow: [despondently] Why? Why, God? Why why why?

Tom: [Q] No, no, no. _I_ come to the Enterprise.

Mike: Remember, anything you say can and will be used against you in a

Tom: Give or take a year.

Crow: Yeah, but can she pat her head while rubbing her stomach?

Tom: I want you all dressed in black.

>        "Come back here," Q said.
>        "Why?" Marrissa asked as she enterd the turbolift.  "You've

Mike: When did the doors learn how to talk?

>said dejectedly.

Crow: Hey Q, you're an omnipotent being. You can wipe her completely out
 of existence. Capish?

>        "You've never had a girl walk out on you?" Jay said. "I'm ten

Mike: Not that that has any relevance to anything whatsoever, it's just
 the truth.

Tom: [Q] Nonsense. I've met lots of preteen girls. I mean--

>        "But you don't expect a Captain to walk out on a all-knowing

>        "What do you exspect?"

Mike: A coherent plot?
Crow: A minimal amount of proofreading?

>                               Jay asked.  "Marrissa to tremble at your

>        "Nothing really."

Tom: [Q] After all, I'm omnipotent.

Crow: Some of us happen to have _jobs._

>        "I'll leave you to your work then.  Why want to grow up so fast

Mike: Here we see the author's wistful desire to recapture his faded
 youth, framed by a cynical rejoinder.

Mike: Investigate the question mark shortage in this fanfic.

Tom: She woke up one morning and they were all gone. She's looked all
 over the quadrant for them.

Tom: Why not? Everyone else seemed to.

Mike: Q's whisked them away to a gaming convention!

>Picard was wearing purple robes and a gold crown with a large ruby at

Mike: I really, really, _really_ hope that was a typo.
Crow: It certainly fits Riker, though.
Tom: Plus it gives new meaning to the words "phallic symbol."

Mike: [singing] It had to be Q...

[1...2...3...4...5...6...]

[Mike, Tom, and Crow are sitting around the desk. Mike is reading a book
and Crow and Tom are looking at a magazine. Suddenly, Tom asks:]

Tom: Uh, how old is Marrissa?

Crow: [together,without] Twelve.
Mike: [   looking up   ] Seventeen.

[Everyone looks at each other.]

Crow: Look, she was like twelve in Enterprized.

Mike: Yeah, but she's aged at least three years since then. When did
 "Disaster" air?

Crow: Do I have fanboy printed across my forehead?

Mike: Ok. So it was around...uh...season four or five. That was about...
 one...two...four years ago. So now she's sixteen or so.

Crow: [rudely] That doesn't mean she _aged_ four years. I mean, look at
 comics. The X-men should all be on social security, but they're all
 still in their twenties and early thirties.

Mike: [aggravated] Oh yeah? Well what about A Royal Mess? That took
 place after Generations. That means she had to be sixteen or over.

Crow: [nasty] Look, boy-o. We're not talking about A Royal Mess are we?
 We're talking about Who Q? Where Q? She's twelve.

Mike: _You_ look, pinbeak. Obviously something is crossed in your
 circuits, because if she was twelve when we first saw her, and
 seventeen in A Royal Mess, she must be somewhere between them.

Crow: Pinbeak? I'm not the imbecile who thinks he can average fanfics
 together, pink boy.

Mike: Nethead!

Crow: Dickweed!

[Crow and Mike launch themselves at each other. They fall to the floor
fighting while Tom continues to read his magazine not noticing the
struggle. After a little bit:]

Tom: Oh, hey, guys. I just remembered. At the beginning it said "But
 then again a twelve and a half year old doesn't usually command a
 diplomatic mission either." Guess that clears that up.

[Crow and Mike stand up. Crow is gnarled. Mike has a black eye and his
jumpsuit is torn.]

Mike: Shall we?

Crow: You first.

[Crow and Mike grab Tom and drag him down behind the desk. The lights
flash.]

Tom: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!

Crow: [behind desk] Ooh. I didn't know he bent like that.

[Mike and the bots enter the theatre. Tom is missing his dome.]
Tom: Ok. I'm sorry. Now give me my head back.
[Mike sticks Tom's head on.]
Crow: By the way, I was right.
Mike: Don't even start.

Tom: Your form stank and you took the third movement far too slowly.

Crow: I'll be your captain tonight. Today's special is the chicken con

Mike: Uh, where's the little ambassador's room?

All: [applauding] Yeah!! Bravo!! Wonderful!!

Tom: [Marrissa] Security, get the nipple clamps.
Mike: [winces] Oooh!

Mike: [whining] Stupid old door. I hate you! I hate you!

Crow: I believe Ratliff has finally written a likable character.

Tom: Our comments are funnier.

>                                               "but as for respect from

>        "RESPECT A HUMAN CHILD," Ekael sneared.  "WHO HASN'T FOUGHT IN
>ANY BATTLES OR VANQUISHED ENEMIES.  NEVER!"

Mike: Here's the setup...

>        "Don't be so sure," Marrissa said, calmly.  "I've commanded

Mike: And it's a hit!

Crow: Available at a fine FTP site near you.

Tom: I suggest you get a spell checker. It saves you some embarrassment.

>        The wind was taken out of Ekael's sails but not Selaw's.
>        "That Troacain slob may allow you to mediate this dispute but I
>will not," Sel Rahc Selaw said, throwing a punch.

All: YES!!!!!
Crow: I can't express how immensely satisfying this is.

>A second punch impacted her left shoulder sending a flash of pain
>accross her face.

All: HURT HER! HURT HER! HURT HER!
Mike: Is this wrong?
Crow: [without a second thought] No.

>                   Marrissa replied with a quick kick to Selaw's
>ankles.  A muffled crack was heard a Selaw fell to the floor.

Mike: [bone crunching noises]
Tom: My spine!!

>        "Now if you would return to your seat we can get on with the
>negotiations," Marrissa said rubbing her shoulder.

Tom: Good thinking, Marrissa. Jiggle it about.

>        "But my legs hurt," Selaw whined.  "I need medical attention."

Crow: [Shatner] A diplomat is down--on Star Trek 911.
Mike: Uh-oh, his legs are broken. They'll have to shoot him now.

>        "So does my shoulder," Marrissa replied, "But you should have
>thought about that before you attacked me."

Crow: I'm sure denying them medical attention will really help win them
 to your side.

>        Selaw crawled back to his seat and into it.  "Why are you
>smiling?" he asked Sel Rahc Akros of Sobnia.

Tom: [Sel Rahc Akros] I get turned on by that kind of thing.

>        "Because all of our plans have been neatly squashed by this
>young girl," Akros replied.  "I planned to seduce the Captain, Ekael
>bribe, and you bully.

Mike: Now we'll have to kill her.

>                       I won't seduce a young girl and I doubt Ekael's
>archaeological treasure will get him far.

Tom: Not past second base, anyway.

>                                           As for bullying, you've
>already failed once."
>        Selaw grumbled and moaned.

Crow: Ohh, the pain...the pain...

>        "Now perhaps we can get down to business," Marrissa said.
>"We'll begin with your statements

Tom: Proceed to questions, and end with exclamations.

>                                  of what you want and don't want from

Crow: [Marrissa] Will the ambassador from Zzzyndor please stop whining?

>Bresa."
>        "My planet simply wants Sobnia as part of a Greater Bresa,"

Tom: Resistance is futile. Sobnia will be assimilated.

>Sel Rahc Selaw moaned.  "As for want we don't want, that is simplicity
>itself.

Mike: How very Zen of you.

>         We want no one else controling Sobnia."
>        "UNEXCEPTABLE," Ekael yelled standing up.
>        "Sit down, be quiet

All: [singing] Sit down, John! Sit down, John! For God sakes, John, sit
 down!

>Marrissa said.  "If you are done Selaw we can go one to Sel Rahc Akros

>nodd.

Tom: And a winkin and a blinkin.

>        "Sobnia wishes complete independence," Sel Rahc Akros said.
>"We do not want anyone else controling any part of Sobnia."
>        "Troac," Marrissa prompted after a moment's silence.
>        "TROAC WANTS A COMPLETE BRES WITHDRAWAL FROM SOBNIA," Sel Rahc
>Ekael said.

Crow: Whoa! Dude! Ease up on the caps lock!

>             "FURTHERMORE WE WISH TO CONTROL IT AND NO ONE ELSE."

All: SHUT UP!!

>        "Do to the fact not one of your positions even remotely match
>and the fact it is nearing lunch time," Marrissa said,

Tom: Lunch is more important to Marrissa than a lasting peace.

>                                                       "we will break
>for lunch.  This afternoon at 1400 hours we will each propose how we

Crow: Uh...by not killing each other?

>                                                     We will continue
>in that fashion until a solution which all of you can agree on is
>found.  Even if it takes until my hair turns gray."

Mike: Even if it takes Ratliff a thousand pages.
Tom: I hope not...

>                                                     Marrissa exited
>the conference room, leaving the Sel Rahcs amazed at her determination

Tom: Then he started coughing up blood.

>        Marrissa entered Sickbay with a tight expression of pain on her
>face.  "Doctor Johnson," she called.

Mike: [Marrissa] Break out the morphine.

>        "What can I do for you?" he asked turning and picking up his
>tricorder.

Crow: [Marrissa] The contractions are two minutes apart!

>        "I think my shoulder is shattered," Marrissa moaned.
>        "Sit up here and I'll have a little look," Doctor Johnson said
>he ran the tricorder over the shoulder.

Mike: Mario says you're doing fine--oh wait. That's my Game Boy.

>                                         "It's just a hairline

>piece of equipment and proceded to run it back and forth over her

Tom: [Johnson] It's just a prop, but act as if it's really working.
Mike: Ratliff has captured the true essence of Star Trek; that pure
 mediocrity that only comes to the divinely inept.

>        "I started the Naklab Negotiation today," Marrissa replied.
>"Sel Rahc Selaw decided that he'd rather I visit Sickbay.

Crow: I'd prefer the morgue.

>        At that moment Sel Rahc Selaw entered suported by his two aids.

Mike: We're not _aids,_ were _paraprofessionals!_

>"Doctor fix my legs," He moaned.  "NOW!"
>        "As soon as I am finished withe the Captain," Doctor Johnson
>said, "I'll be glad to treat you all.  Nurse get him on a bed."

All: Helloooooooo Nurse!

>        "Now, Doctor," Selaw moaned  loudly as he was laid

Crow: [moaning] Oh doctor, ohhh, ohhh, doctor...
Mike: Stop that.

>                                                           up on the

Tom: [Johnson] Doan y'all mind my spontanee-us aquisishun of an accent.

Mike: Yeah, _that's_ what cures a shattered collarbone.

 earlier. Nah...

Tom: No, no, no Mike! That's all over. This is Ratliff now.
Mike: [uncertain] Are you sure?

Crow: Or was that three five-masters? Or maybe it was seven two-masters.
 Then again...

 quarter her troops at Bunker Hill for the winter.

Mike: Like so much cannon fodder.

Mike: Strangely enough, Commander Earnheart had disappeared, though it
 was frequently rumored that he was writing for "The Simpsons."
Tom: You do realize that there's an "n" in there, don't you?

Tom: On Risa?

Mike: But it might help the ones who aren't dead anymore.

Tom: So the entire universe would die because some piddling backwater
 planets are having a civil war? Yeah, right.

Subject: MiSTing: Who Q? Where Q? [5/8]

[Continued from part 4]

[SOL. There are pictures of Stephen Ratliff everywhere. Scattered about
are reams of paper (supposedly containing the various fanfics written by 
Ratliff).]

Mike: [looking about] What is all this?

Tom: It's for the Ratliff Admiration Society.

Crow: What?

Tom: The Ratliff Admiration Society. It's dedicated to that most
 industrial of fanfic writers: Stephen Ratliff.

Mike: Shouldn't that be "illustrious?"

Tom: [ignoring him] Come, join us in our hymn. [sings] A writer of
 fanfic named Ratliff/Drew aim on the Trek universe--

Mike: Uh, Tom, are you serious?

Tom: Of course! Or should I say, "Of coarse!" Have you ever truly looked
 at Ratliff's literary accomplishments?

Mike: He has some?

Tom: [continuing] I mean, he took an obscure character and has created
 an entire series about her; followed her from adolescence through
 puberty (remember that poignant moment in Away from Home when we were
 told of her first period?)--

Crow: [gagging] Thank you. I had just finished repressing that.

Tom: --through the myriad misadventures leading up to her own command in
 Timespeeder.

Mike: There's another fanfic out there? Uh-oh.

Tom: What other writer has engaged the imaginations of MiSTies
 everywhere? Why, Ratliff has provided us with the source of some of the
 greatest MiSTings ever! Do you remember that first moment when you read
 "All spelling errors are to be ingored?"

Mike: Unfortunately, yes.

Tom: Ratliff, in his incompetence, has reached giddying heights of bad
 prose that are almost beautiful in their complete lack of aesthetics.

Crow: Isn't that a paradox?

Tom: [almost crying] Can't you see? His childlike optimism, his devotion
 to his craft in spite of his complete lack of anything resembling basic
 English skills, his obsession with Marrissa similar to Dante's for
 Beatrice or Poe's for Annabelle...it's so..._beautiful,_ in a pathetic,
 loopy sort of way.

Mike: Hmm. Then I guess you won't mind going back into the theatre to
 finish the fanfic.

Tom: [immediately straightening up] Uh--that's not necessary. After all,
 we can admire from afar.

Mike: I thought as much. [light flashes] We've got fanfic sign!

[Chaos. Mike grabs Tom and drags him off.]

Tom: NOOOOOOOOOooooooo...

[6...5...4...3...2...1...]

[Everyone enters. Mike sets Tom down.]
Tom: [to Mike] I resent you.

Tom: Unfortunately, they were the wrong Klingon and two human boys.

>        "Careful Jay, you know how I hate that nickname," Marrissa

Mike: And you know what happened to last person who called me that.

>         "The Doctor here tells me that the Bres are having target
>practice with the population of Overjaras as targets."

Crow: My, she's flippant about genocide.

>        "So, I've heard," Jay said.
>        "So here is what I'm going to do.  Alexander contact ..."

Mike: Cut to montage! Oh, wait. This is a fanfic. Never mind.

Crow: Egelhcs locks--they're the namrebod of locks.

Mike: In the valley lay picturesque rotting corpses.

>Overjaras would have been a great place for shore leave.

Crow: If you reserve your seats now, you get the lovely Lebanon beach
 party package too.

Crow: I'm Batman.
Tom: My name is Inego Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Mike: "I'm John Wilkes Booth." "But John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln."
 "Attention has been paid."

>        "I thought that would be obvious," Marrissa replied.  "We are

>        "Since when did Starfleet start hiring Klingon shimps,"

Mike: They had so much success with Klingon Moes and Larrys they bought
 the whole set.

>        "I wish you hadn't said that," Marrissa sighed.

Mike: Because.
Crow: Why?
Mike: Just because.
Crow: Why?

All: Kupo!

Mike: Yeah, but if you saved Lone Wolf he gave you the Golden Hairpin.

Tom: [Alexander] Whittle while you work...

>        "I'll go get Colonel Elbourt," the guard said retreating into

Crow: Come on! What kind of guard is intimidated by a bunch of kids
 armed with only a pocketknife?

>
>        Colonel Elbuort emerged from the tent.

Tom: Uh-oh. This guy is T-R-O-U-B-L-E.
Mike: This has to be the lamest fanfic ever.

>Marrissa said.
>        "And why should I do that?" Elbuort sneered.
>        "Number One, you are voilating the cease-fire agreement,"

Mike: The U.N. is going to give you a very stern lecture unless you
 stop.

>Marrissa enumerated.  "Number Two, if you don't your gun will be
>disassambled and removed from this sight.  And Number Three, it would
>make me very happy.

All: [laugh]
Tom: Oh, please...

>        "I don't care about the cease-fire," the Colonel replied.  "If
>you take my gun away you will damage Starfleet's image of treating all
>sides equally.

Tom: Not if you're breaking the cease fire agreement, you dink.

>                And why should I care about your feelings."

Crow: Or question marks.

>        "You do have a point but I am not the one who will possess your

>        "Then who will?"

Mike: The Spirit of Christmas Past.

>        "The Klingon Empire of coarse," Alexander said.  "We don't like

Crow: Where?
Tom: Three inches above the waist.

>                       words.  Alexander, son of Worf, Ambassador at
>large from the Klingon High Council, at your service."

Crow: When did that happen? Did I miss a plot point somewhere?

>        "I wouldn't insult him sir," the guard said from within the
>tent.  "The last one to do so was forced off a cliff and died."

Tom: Of course, I don't have any proof, but he _does_ have a Swiss army
 knife and a bad temperament.

>        "What do you intend to do," Colonel Elbuort asked.

Crow: Force correct punctuation on you.

>        "Ross, please quote the cease-fire agreement for me," Alexander
>said.

Mike: [Ross] Um...please stop firing. There.

>        "An outside party may take action to prevent or end hostilities
>during mediation," Ross replied.

Crow: Excuse me? What? Why on God's green earth would you ever think to
 put a clause like that in an agreement?
Mike: Don't question; just accept.

>                                  "This action may include up to the

Tom: Ooh, I'd hate to be detanted.
Mike: What's that mean?
Tom: I'm not sure, but it _sounds_ unpleasant.

Crow: By questioning the credibility of the prosecution's star witness.

>aren't going to dissassemble it with that?" Colonel Elbuort said
>alarmed.
>        "I'm eleven years old," Alexander said welding the scalpel.

Mike: Not that has anything to do with anything; it's just a fact.

>"Gun disassembling hasn't exactly been in my education, and you'ld be
>surprised what this thing cuts though."

Crow: Even shoe leather?
Tom: Yes.
Crow: Amazing!

>        "If my men disassemble it for you," Colonel Elbuort said,
>"would that be acceptable?  While you watch of coarse."
>        "It would," Alexander said.  "And to show my graitude, I'll

Mike: Alexander to Ten Forward. Break out the liquor.

Mike: [shocked] Marrissa!
Crow: [Marrissa] Sweet booze doesn't break treaties on me. I always know
 just what I'm getting with booze.

Tom: Let's disappear too.

[1...2...3...4...5...6...]

[Tom and Crow appear to be in some sort of mystical garb. On the desk is
a rather blurry freeze frame of Marrissa from "Disaster." They are
chanting when Mike enters.]

Mike: Hey, whatcha guys doing?

Tom: Silence, mortal! Do not interrupt our religious ceremony for our
 beloved god.

Crow: Yeah, dork.

Mike: And who is your beloved god?

Crow: The all-seeing, all-knowing, all-smelling [heavy reverb] MARRISSA!

Mike: Come off it. Marrissa isn't a god.

Tom: You would like to think that, wouldn't you, Unbeliever? Well, who
 commands the Enterprise?

Mike: Marrissa.

Crow: Who happens to have everything work out just perfectly for her,
 even to the point of defying the laws of physics and probability?

Mike: Um, Marrissa.

Tom: Who created humanity?

Mike: Now wait--

Crow: Reflect on verse 3:16 from the Gospel according to Ratliff: For
 Marrissa so lovd the world. taht SHe gave her only begoten parents so
 that whosoever beleived in Her chould have ever lasting life.

Tom: Come, Michael, help us render our burnt offerings up to Her.

Mike: But I don't believe that--

Crow: Yeah, but you're the only one of us with functional arms.

Mike: All right. What do I do?

Tom: Take these Star Wars figures and set 'em on fire.

Mike: No!

Crow: Please?

Mike: No, for I am a firm believer in the Holy Trinity of Anakin, Luke,
 and Leia.

Tom: [gasping] You don't mean--!

Mike: Yes! I am a Lucasian!

[A moment of stunned silence from the bots until:]

Crow: JIHAD!

[Tom and Crow leap on Mike. All three fall behind the desk and scuffle
for a few seconds before the commercial sign lights flash.]

Crow: The Britain has the ball! I think it might go all the way!

Tom: Ach, ya. Vaht puny girlie torpedoes.

Tom: Hey! Above they had a shorter firing range than the Enterprise!
Mike: Yes, but they're closing the gap between them faster than the
 Enterprise is.
Tom: Oh. Huh?

Mike: Four starships fell. The Bres and the Enterprise missed each other

Crow: I don't know.

Mike: Absolute power...

 the better.

 so well in the talent portion.

Tom: [Worf] I didn't have the money I owed Riker from poker, and he sent
 some goons to collect in blood.

Mike: With a sledge hammer.

Crow: I--but--it's just that--why? Why, why, why? It doesn't make any

Mike: Hang in there, Crow. Just a few more pages.

All: AAAAAAHHH!
Tom: Ratliff's fantasies bubble up out of his unconscious in the most
 disturbing way possible.

>        "Shame on you for insunuating such a thing," Commander Riker
>said.  "You know It's just the Junior Officeer's champ.  She asked to

>        Marrissa Picard entered the room in her red duty uniform.  This
>was unsual for her as she usaully wore a T-shirt and skirt when off-

Mike: A short skirt which showed off her well-formed calves; her skin
 tanned to a deep bronze, almost the color of her long, flowing hair.
Tom: This fanfic has finally snapped your mind, hasn't it, Nelson?

>       "Hello Couselor, Commanders, Dad," She said.
>        "Marrissa what are you doing here," Captain Picard, her adopted
>father

Mike: Thanks for reminding us, Stephen. I almost forgot.

>       asked, turning toward her.
>        "You suggested that I should learn poker," Marrissa said.
>"It's been quite profitable."

Crow: [Marrissa] Today I learned everything there is to know about poker
 and the day before, Klingon martial arts. Tomorrow I'm going to learn
 brain surgery.

>        "How profitable?" Geordi asked, trying to size up Marrissa.

All: Boo!!
Tom: So, somewhere between Cadet Cruise and this fanfic did Ratliff
 finally hit puberty?

>        "You will have to find out that for youself," Marrissa replied.
>        "If you are ready the game is ..." Riker began.

Mike: Third prime card poker. One eyed jacks and perfect squares wild.
Tom: Where'd you learn to play?
Mike: At Math Club.

>herself and her father.

>        The next morning Commander Riker found Captain Picard in the

Tom: He was drinking in the sights.

>        Motioning toward a pip in front of a chair with a smaller that

Mike: By John Dos Passos.
Crow: You know, it took me forever to find all of the USA trilogy.

>        "You are promoting her and transfering her to security," Riker
>guessed.
>        "No the uniform is for Clara Sutter," Captain Picard said.

Tom: Then why did you motion towards it?

>       "LaForge wanted her to assist him in engineering on a regular

>can't give her without a rank.  Besides Commander, the uniform is much
>to small for Marrissa."

Mike: Says Ratliff, who has her dimensions memorized.
Crow: This fanfic makes me feel dirty all over.

>        "Then lets call them in," Riker said.
>        "Marrissa is bringing Clara here any minute now on the pretense

Crow: When she comes through the door, we jump her and take her lunch
 money.

>                        Captain Picard said.  "I'm sure Clara doesn't
>expect a position in Starfleet for her eleventh birthday."

Tom: Oh, so ranks aren't given out due to skill, but as presents. That's
 one step above nepotism.

Tom: [Marrissa] Aaaaaaaooooouuuch! My neck!
Mike: [Picard] Sorry. I didn't--oh man, there's blood. Geez--it's all
 over! What'd I do? Hit an artery?

Mike: Well boys, we made it through another Ratliff fanfic in one piece.
 What do you boys think?

Tom: You remember my Ratliff Admiration Society?

Mike: Yes.

Tom: You remember Crow's and my Marrissa cult?

Mike: Yes.

Tom: We were wrong. Horribly, horribly wrong. Four as an approximation
 of pi wrong. The earth is flat wrong. The rationale behind a second Ace
 Ventura movie wrong.

Crow: Whoa there, Tommy. Not _that_ wrong.

Tom: Well, almost.

Mike: What do you think, sir?

Dr. F: [smug] What did you think of _that,_ mother?

Mrs. F: That was truly evil, Clayton. Maybe you're not the pathetic
