Be warned. What follows is a MiSTing of the M*nos of fanfics...

[Nighttime on the SOL. Lights are lowered.  Suddenly a siren goes off. The 
siren is loud and irritating. Think car alarm, but worse.
Crow, in nightshirt (with nightcap), runs through screaming.
Tom, in pajamas, runs through screaming, from the opposite direction.
Mike, in jammies and bathrobe, runs in. He's putting on bunny slippers as he
runs.]

Mike: What's going on? What's that noise?
Crow: <Screams>
Tom: <Screams>
Mike: Okay, guys, settle down. What the...? Oh, I see. Chester and Spike are
calling. <Hits the button, the siren stops immediately>
Dr. F: Well, well, well. Nice bunny slippers, Merrick. What happened? Diddums
get his beauty sleep interrupted?
Mike: Hey, c'mon, this isn't fair! We're not due for a movie till tomorrow
morning. I haven't had time to make an invention yet!
Dr. F: Oh, a procrastinator, eh, Milton? Well, you'll pay for that... Frank,
tell them what they get.
Frank: Oh, guys, you're real lucky. We've got an alt.startrek.creative fanfic
for you.
Tom: <runs in, stops.> Alt.startrek.creative fanfic? Nooooo!! <runs off
screaming>
Crow <runs through screaming>
Mike: Hey, c'mon. I've read that group before. They have some good writing on
there <pause> sometimes.
Dr. F: Well, Milli Vanilli, this one is not one of the good ones. In fact,
it's so bad you'll wish you were watching "Monster-A-Go-Go!" Hahahahaha!!!!
Mike: Monster-A- ...what??
Dr. F: I hate you, Morgenstern. Send him the fanfic, Frank.
Tom and Crow <run by screaming>
<fanfic sign flashes>
Mike: Hey guys, look! We've got fanfic sign!
Tom and Crow <pause, look at each other, scream, run off screaming in opposite
directions>

6...5...4...3...2...1...0

[Mike carries a screaming Tom in and plunks him in his seat.
Crow runs in and runs up and down the front, screaming.]
Mike: Shhhh, guys, it'll be okay. How bad can it be?
Crow: <In his seat now> Well, there was a little piece called "Cyborged..."
Tom: <screams>
Crow: <screams>

Tom: "Sircled?"
Crow: So, how you wanna shoot 'em, sir?
Mike: Well, try to shoot 'em without looking like you're trying to.
Crow: How'm I supposed to do that?
Mike: I don't know. Fire casual.

>He said.

All: Hi Wes!
Tom: Not one, not two, but *three* spelling errors in Wesley Crusher's name
	alone. 
Crow: Hey, wait a minute. Does the capital "H" mean that Wesley Crusher is
	God?
Tom: No, it just means that the author can neither spell nor proofread.
Crow: Well, as long as Wesley isn't God, what does it matter?

>         After noting some surprised looks around the room,

Crow: I guess they thought he'd been killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts.

Tom: Wrong ship! Get the hell outta here!

>        "How else can I surprise my mom?" Wes asked.

Tom: Remember her birthday!
Mike: Clean your room!
Crow: Stop being such a smartass all the time!

>        As Westly completed the sentence, Dr Chrusher entered

Crow: And ravished her cruelly! Ha ha!

>        "I didn't think I'd surprise her that much," Westly

All:<muted trumpet imitation> Wah-wah-wahhhhhh.

>        Picard looked around and ordered, "Number One, take the

Crow: Fast-forwarding to the good parts in "The Wicked Lady."

>section behind.  It will However cover the Enterprise-C with room

Tom: Room to spare, but less than eight meters?

>        "That means we will need some one to crew the saucer
>section and we don't have crew to spare,"  Picard said .
>"Suggestions?"

Mike: <Riker voice> I'll take it! That saucer section's a babe magnet!

>        "We could use the kid's crew," Westly suggested.
>        "Kid's crew," Riker said, "who's idea was that?"

Crow: His. Weren't you listening either?

>        "Marrissa Flores," Westly said. "She formed it after

Crow: Say now...
Mike: Watch it, Crow.

>        "I know young Marrissa," Picard said,

Crow: Biblically?

Tom: Oh, sure. *That's* why you go into battle with kids on the ship.

>        "What was you _Kobayshi_Maru_ time Captain," Westly
>asked.
>        "15 minutes but I don't see how that helps out,"
>Picard said.

Crow: Didn't last too long, did he?
Tom: Oh, that was low.

>        "Marrissa's is 20," Westly replied.
>        "20 minutes my time was 13," Riker said.
>        "Mine was 14:03.467879," Data said.
>        "We should make sure this young lady gets into Starfleet

>        "12 Hours, Captain," Geordi said.

Tom: We've got to practice our technobabble.

>        "Saucer separation will occur at 2300 hours," Picard said.
>"We depart for Romulus via timetravel at 0100 hours.

Mike: Not a word, Crow. Not a word.

Tom: <falsetto> Oh, wait, I can't. Mom'll get real mad if I'm not back for

Mike: Tom, you okay?
Tom: <makes bizarre, gasping noises>
Crow: I think the fanfic's made him swallow his tongue!
Mike: He doesn't *have* a tongue.
Crow: Okay, fine. *You* tell *me* what's wrong.
Mike: I don't know. Let's get him out of here! 
<They exit the theater>

<Through the doors...>

Tom is on the counter. Mike is examining his chassis.
Crow: Well, what is it?
Mike: <Flipping thru his copy of _E-Z Bot Repair_> I don't know. I don't -
	wait! Tom, you've got something jammed in here real good... <he pokes at
	Tom's innards with a screwdriver>

Crow: What the hey?
<A pause to build up tension>
Tom: <falsetto> Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
Crow: Why you little -!
Tom: Oh, come on, Crow, it was funny!
Mike: Tom, we were worried about you.
Crow: Yeah, I thought your head might blow up or something.
Tom: Oh, Crow, really. It takes more than a bad fanfic to make my head
	explode.
Crow: Oh, then you're ready to go back in?
Tom: Um... well, sure, but if you don't want to, that's fine...
Crow: I wanna go.
Mike and Tom <simultaneously>: You DO?
Crow: Sure. I mean, it's *bad*, but not *that* bad. 
Mike: Huh?
<Crow nudges Mike.>
Mike: Ohhhh. I get it. Yeah, Tom, Crow's right. We're going back in.
<Fanfic sign flashes, Mike picks Tom up>
Tom: No! No! Really, it's fine if we take a break!
Mike: It's fanfic sign now, Tom. We have to go.
Tom: <a wail of anguish usually reserved for the utterly damned>

<Through the doors, back into the theater>

Crow: You deserve to suffer, Servo.
Tom: Okay, I'm sorry. It was a joke, okay?
Crow: I'm still not speaking to you.
Tom: You just did.
Crow: That was the last time ever.
Tom: You just did it again.
Crow: Well, *that* was the last time.
Tom: You just-

Crow: How do you get that?
Tom: Look at the Stardate. It was 47567.25 when the fanfic started.
Crow: I can't believe you noticed that.

>ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN (and just might)

Tom: It's over! It's over!
<They exit the theater>
<Door sequence>

Tom: Oh, thank goodness that's over. What a nightmare!
Crow: Y'know, I think that was worse than "Cyborged."
Tom: I'd be inclined to agree with you, Crow.
Crow: Hey, wait. The Floras kid's parents died before she was even born.
	Right?
Tom: Yeah...
Crow: So, if they died before she was born, she couldn't have been born,
	right?
Tom: You mean...
Crow: Yep. This fanfic never happened. It's all a bad dream.
Mike: I dunno, Crow. I think you're reaching a little.
Crow: Oh, c'mon, Mike! Think about it. If Marrissa was never born, than
	a good part of the plot of this fanfic -
Mike: Plot?
Crow: Okay, pseudo-plot. A good part of the fanfic couldn't have happened
	without Marrissa, right?
Mike: Yeah...
Crow: In fact, Marrissa was *so* critical to the pseudo-plot that without
	her the fanfic wouldn't exist, would it?
Mike: But -
Crow: But nothing! Mike, I'm telling you, this fanfic never happened.
Tom:  Crow, I like your reasoning. Mike, just accept it. This fanfic
	was nothing more than a dream, a bad dream.
Crow: A *very* bad dream.
Mike: Your logic's flawed, guys. You see - <light flashes> Hang on, Wally and the Beav
	are calling. <he hits the button>
Dr. F: Well, Melville, how was the fanfic?
Crow: Fanfic?
Tom: What fanfic?
Dr. F: Don't try to play with my mind, lab rats. You know exactly what I mean.
Crow: We didn't get any fanfic.
Tom: <Shakes head adamantly>
Dr. F: But we know you got it! Frank, they got it, didn't they?
Frank: <wandering in from the right> Got what?
Dr. F: The fanfic!
Frank: Fanfic? What fanfic?
Dr. F: "Enterprized," by Stephen Ratliff.
Frank: Never heard of it.
Dr. F: Frank, it's bad enough with them doing this, but *you*?
Frank: What?
Dr. F: The fanfic, Frank.
Frank: What fanfic?
Dr. F: The fanfic we just - oh, never mind. <Turns back to camera, looks very confused> Ahem. Well, gentlemen, never mind. I'm going to go lie down for a while.
 <wanders off>
<Back on the Satellite>
Crow: There, Mike, you see? It never happened. What more proof do you need?
Mike: I confess I'm at a loss for words.
<Deep 13>
Frank: Dr. Forrester, do you want your teddy bear?
Dr F: Yes, thank you, Frank. Oh, and would you push the button?
<Frank pushes the button. Zap to black.>
