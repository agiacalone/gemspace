Here is the third and final part of the MiSTing of Stephen Ratliff's
"Away From Home."  If you have not read parts 1 or 2, I strongly
suggest that you do so before reading this.  And if you read all 
three parts without a break, I strongly suggest that you go lie down
before you hurt yourself.

As always, comments are very welcome.  Just send your e-mail to me at
barklage@ucsu.colorado.edu, and I will forward it to the other authors,
Todd Gilbert and Petrea Mitchell.

[Mike and the bots enter the theater.  Tom's globe is magically healed.]

MIKE: You gonna be all right, Tom?
TOM: I think so.
MIKE: Because I don't want you conking out anymore.  There's a lot more
      Ratliff to get through.
CROW: <swoons> Ohhh... now *I* don't feel so good.
MIKE: Don't you start.

TOM: Ooooh, pretty.
MIKE: Ladies and gentlemen, the one good part of this fanfic.  Enjoy it 
      while it lasts.
CROW: Looks like the old Enterprise got kinda wrung out.

TOM: A Next Generation story *in* the Marrissa stories?  Marrissa gets top 
     billing now?
MIKE: She must have one heck of an agent.

MIKE: ...pretending they weren't just naked.

CROW: Must be a *really* slow news week.

<Mike grabs Tom>
TOM: I'm okay with it, Mike.  Really.
MIKE: Just making sure.

>       "But, how can I get away from the media," Marrissa asked.  
> "They follow me to class, to dinner, even into the locker room."

CROW: Those aren't reporters, honey.  They're child pornographers.

>       "That may be a problem," Troi commented.
>       "Maybe not," Captain Picard said.  "The Media will follow any

MIKE: Hey, that's dirty!

TOM: <sings> Earthborn seeds fly outward, let the stars beware!

CROW: The Institute for Engineering and... Museuming?

MIKE: You'd think that would be the other way around.

>       "I'll take Risa," Marrissa said.  

TOM: I'll take Manhattan!

CROW: Of course, we're not sure *why*...

> However, they wouldn't let her go to Risa under any circumstance."

MIKE: No spring breaks in her future.

>       "I have a problem with Risa," Captain Picard said, dryly.

TOM: It really blocks me up.

CROW: <Marrissa> I'll be looking for *chicks*!

MIKE: <Marrissa> But I'll have some laxatives with me.  They should help.

TOM: Would you look for *any* 13 year old on Risa?

>       "Al-right you can go," Picard caved in.  

CROW: Ugh.  I'm not cleaning that up.

> "However if I here a

MIKE: Don't worry, I'm sure LaForge will behave.

TOM: Cher!

MIKE: <reporter> Well, it's not Marrissa, but let's follow her anyway.

TOM: All two of them.

>       Arriving at Risa, Lieutenant Commander Geordi LaForge and

MIKE: *The* registration desk?  What is Risa, a spacegoing hotel?

> "You are sir," The hotel clerk asked.
>       "Lieutenant Commander Geordi LaForge, starship Enterprise"

TOM: ...or what's left of it.

>       "Room 138 in the West Wing," he responded.  "And you are young

CROW: <Geordi> No, *she* is young lady.  I am blind black man.

>       "Amber Flores," Marrissa responded.
>       "Room 139 in the West wing, the Valet will take your bags," the

MIKE: No one will be seated during the intense "Hotel Registration" scene.

>       Meanwhile across the room 

TOM: Oh, so Risa's just a room.

>                                 a couple of Starfleet Lieutenants were

CROW: Hey, look, it's a Deus Ex Moronica.

>       "I doubt the famous Captain Picard would let his daughter visit
> Risa" Lieutenant Phillip Andrews junior replied.
>       "But that's Picard's Chief Engineer with her," Crocker rebutted.
> "Surely that would be a sufficant escort."

MIKE: Who, LaForge?  The guy who fell into a plasma tube last section and 
      found out a pre-teen could do his job?

>       "However it could ..."
>       "Your not going to suggest that she's his date," Crocker
> interrupted.  

TOM: Chris Crocker, heir to the cake mix empire!      

> "Their may not be a minimum age on Risa, but I doubt
> Lieutenant Commander LaForge is that sdespurt.  

MIKE: Hey, this is Geordi "Holodeck Lover" LaForge, so you never know.
CROW: I'm trying to figure out how Ratliff got from "desperate" to 
      "sdespurt."

> I mean dating the
> Captain's daughter that is really going far for a date."

MIKE: Hey, *every* woman is some Captain's daughter.

>       "We haven't proven that she is Marrissa Picard," Andrews
> replied.
>       "That's easy enough, we ask her," Crocker responded getting up.

CROW: I guess these losers really don't have anything better to do.

> 
>       Meanwhile Marrissa was telling Geordi, "I think I'll change into

TOM: And do something about that G rating.

>       "I've got to report our arrival to the Captain," Geordi replied.
> "I'll see you at the pool after I'm done."  

MIKE: Can Geordi swim with that visor?

> Geordi exited the lobby and
> Marrissa began walking across the room to the West wing entrance.

CROW: Which of course brings us to... Max Geldray!

>       Halfway to the arch way Lieutenants Crocker and Andrews
> intercepted her.  "Are you Lieutenant Picard?" Crocker asked.
>       "Gentlemen, I'm trying to avoid the media," Marrissa responded.
> "Don't blow my cover.  

TOM: Well, that whole "assumed name" thing didn't last too long.
MIKE: Couldn't she have just said "no, I'm not"?

> By the way, who are you?"
>       "I'm Lieutenant Phillip Andrews of the Baltimore. This is
> Lieutenant Chris Crocker of the same."

CROW: The USS Same?  That's a lousy name for a starship.

>       "Phillip Andrews, I had a Captain by that name under my command
> at Naklab," Marrissa responded.  "Any relation?"
>       "He's my father," Andrews replied.
>       "Oh really," Marrissa commented.  

MIKE: <Marrissa> Like the doings of you ordinary mortals really interest me.

> "Gentlemen, if you will excuse me I have to change.  See you later."  

TOM: <Marrissa> I have to go find some *interesting* people.

> Marrissa entered the west wing.
>       "I told you she was Marrissa Picard," Crocker said.
>       "She never told us her name," Andrew replied.
>       "But what other young girl commanded your father?' Crocker
> pointed out.

CROW: Well, if you don't count Bunny down at the strip club...

>       "You do have a point," Andrews conceded.

>       Data and Clara had arrived at the Daystorm institute.  Clara was

>       "Wait awhile, I am finding this quite humorous," Data said with

MIKE: Data, your emotion chip needs some fine-tuning.
TOM: See, even *he* can't take this story seriously.

>       "What do you think will happen when we tell them about the news

>       "We will find out how may reporters can fit in a shuttle craft,"
> Data dead panned.  Clara broke down laughing.
> 

CROW: Repair crew to shuttle bay 3...
MIKE: Boy, she's easily amused.

>       Commander Riker and a blond haired girl in a uniform with
> lieutenant's pips arrived at Deep Space Nine.  

TOM: Oh, that Riker, he changes women as often as he changes his socks! 

> A press conference was set up on the Promenade.  

CROW: What a coincidence!  We were going to hold a press conference, too!

> As the girl made her way to the podium, Riker
> pushed questioning reporters aside.

MIKE: <reporter> Hey, there's only three of us here!  You don't have to push!

>       Standing behind the podium the girl began, "Ladies and
> Gentlemen of the media, I suppose you want to ask me questions like :

TOM: "Why the hell are you pretending to be Marrissa Picard?"

> How does it feel to be Captain Picard's daughter? What is Captain Picard
> like? 

CROW: ...when he's not liquored up.

> and How did you pull off the Naklab Treaty?"

MIKE: ...and slip into something more comfortable?

>       "I'd love to answer those questions," the girl said removing her
> blond wig revealing her short brown hair.  "but as you can see I'm not
> Marrissa Picard."

TOM: Ooh, it was Shayna all along!
CROW: <Shayna> And I would've gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been
      for you meddling kids!

>       A gasp and a wig when though the media.  

MIKE: Hey, Ratliff almost turned a good phrase.

> "I am Shayna Sachs,

TOM: <Shayna> ...and I am an alcoholic.

> Marrissa's current Kid's crew chief engineer.  When activated I 

CROW: ...wet myself and say "mommy".

> hold the rank of acting-Lieutenant.  

MIKE: When in reality I simply can't act.

>       "However, Marrissa has sent a recorded statement for you.

TOM: ...for the low price of $19.95.  Plase buy souveneirs in the lobby.

>       The Cardassian view screen came to life with the view of Marrissa
> sitting behind a desk with a star field in the background.

CROW: So it's a still-life.

>       "Welcome to Deep Space Nine, Ladies and Gentlemen," Marrissa

MIKE: Remember to record your frequent flier miles.

> As you have no doubt

TOM: <Marrissa> And I'm not on Risa either.

> I am taking a vacation in order to releave the stress

TOM: <Marrissa> But don't look for me on Risa, because I'm not there.

MIKE: Woodword and Bernstein.

CROW: <Marrissa> He won't need this where he's gone!  Mwahahahahaaaa!

> "Some reporters are barred from this

MIKE: They will spend the week with their nose in a corner.

ALL: <stunned silence>
CROW: Mike, this is wrong.
MIKE: I know.
TOM: They're leering at a 13-year-old girl!
MIKE: I know!

> "Too bad she is a Lieutenant," Andrews sighed.

CROW: <Andrews> I could really go for some statutory rape.

>       "Too bad she is a Captain's daughter," Crocker responded.
>       "Too bad she is too young," Andrews said.

TOM: Stop it!  STOP IT!!  
MIKE: This is like fantasizing about your little sister. 

>       At that Ensign Najib Fahim joined the Lieutenants admiring

CROW: Hi, token minority reporting for duty.

> "What's this Phillip," he asked.  "Some one is to young for you."

MIKE: Guys, we're getting a dark, disturbing glimpse into Ratliff's mind.

>       "That girl over their," Andrews pointed out.  "But she is

>       "Oh - finally someone the great Phillip Andrews won't touch,"

ALL: <boo, hiss>
TOM: Come on, this isn't "Romeo and Juliet"!

>       "We know better," Crocker said.  "You don't mess around with a
> Captain's daughter."

CROW: Are you implying that if she was anyone else's 13-year-old daughter,
      she'd be fair game?

>       "I'm not a scared little Lieutenant," Ensign Fahim said as he

TOM: Ensign Buttafuoco springs into action!

>       "That's right you are an Ensign who was a Lieutenant before he
> shot the Captain's wife out the torpedo bay," Andrews replied.  

MIKE: A demotion for murder one?  What does it take to get kicked out of 
      Starfleet??
CROW: Well, murder's okay, but they're really strict about neatness.

>       "You're on," Crocker replied.

TOM: <whimpers> They're betting on whether or not he can seduce a 
     13-year-old!

>       Najib approached the young Lieutenant Picard.  After delivering

ALL: YAY!!

> He said something else and she stocked off.  Najib pursued her.  

MIKE: Hit him harder this time!

> As they neared the pool she stopped,

CROW: And for one brief shining moment, I admire her.

>       "Pay up Chris," Andrews said.

>       "Wait a minute, he got himself into it," Andrews responded.  "He

TOM: He baked his bread, let him swim in it... or something like that.
MIKE: Ladies and gentlemen, please accept our sincerest apologies for that 
      last scene.

>       Meanwhile back at Starbase 151, Captain Jean-Luc Picard was
> visiting an old friend.  

CROW: An old friend by the name of "Jack Daniels".

> "Welcome to the Stargazer, Captain Picard,

TOM: No Star Trek character shall escape this fanfic unscathed!

> "'bout time the Captain of record visited."
>       "Captain of record?" Picard asked.

MIKE: Duke of Earl?

CROW: Um... why?  Is Scotty planning on waging his own little war or 
      something?

>       "Just what does that entail?" Picard inquired.

TOM: Booze.  And lots of it.

>       "Expansion of Main Shuttle bay," Scotty began.  "Upper and lower

MIKE: Why not just build a whole new ship instead?
CROW: "This Old Ship," with Bob Vila.

>       "Sounds like a big job," Doctor Crusher commented.

TOM: <Crusher> Could someone tell me what I'm doing in this scene?

>       "That it is lassie, that it is," Scotty said.

MIKE: But I'll just get my assistant Al to do all the work.

>       "Then she will be out of service for quite some time," Picard

>       "Only a couple more years, and only six months of those will she

>       "How much is done so far?" Picard asked.
>       "The structural reframing around the fighter bay, turbolift
> reconfiguration and remodeled sick bay by Doctor McCoy," Scotty listed.

TOM: Ooh, a sickbay designed by a crotchety 140-year-old doctor.
CROW: I wonder how many prune juice dispensers and recliners there'll be.

>       "Let's see this new sick bay," Crusher requested.  
>       "This way."

MIKE: Dr. McCoy is the corpse in the second bed.

CROW: You sass that Deanna Troi?  She's one hoopy frood.

ALL: <barf noises>

ALL: <more barf noises>

>       "Patch it down here," Troi replied.

CROW: <Leslie Nielsen> I just wanted to tell you good luck, we're all

>       "Admiral"
>       "You are aware of the situation on board the Coral Sea?"

MIKE: They're partyin' like it's 2399!

>       "Yes, the Command crew is down with food poisoning and unlikely

TOM: How do you get food poisoning from replicators, anyway?

> "A young Lieutenant is in command and most of the crew is nervous."

CROW: Oh, only the high-ranking officers are allowed to party.

>       "Lieutenant Watson has asked to be relieved," Admiral Necheyev

MIKE: He's been on the bridge without a bathroom break for two days now.

> "I have seen fit to grant his request.  Commander Troi, you are

ALL: <general snickering>
TOM: Captain Troi?  Isn't that like saying President Quayle?

>       "But, I'm a ship's Counselor," Troi protested.

CROW: Well, I guess if a PMSing preteen can command a starship, so can you.

>       "Trust me you are admiralablily suited for the Coral Sea's

MIKE: <Troi> Oh, now I'm an admiral too?

>       "Which is?"

TOM: Look hot and discover the obvious.

>       "After arriving at Betazed," Necheyev began.  "You will depart
> at Ambassador Troi's conveinance on coarse to Deep Space Nine.

CROW: Like we said, *no* character shall escape unscathed!

>       "The Away Team has brought up a virus which is rapidly

CROW: They should start wearing condoms on those away missions.
MIKE: Actually, it's not a virus, just an acute reaction to this fanfic.

> "You Kid's crew has been isolated since

TOM: And so are we!  Let's go.

[Mike picks up Tom and they all leave the theater.]

1...2...3...4...5...6...*...

[SOL.  Mike, Tom, and Crow are behind the counter.  Tom and Crow are 
sobbing and whimpering.  Mike is trying to comfort them.]

MIKE: Come on, you guys.  Cheer up, it's only a fanfic.
TOM: <sobbing> I can't!  It's too horrible!
CROW: <ditto> We won't make it!  I know it!
MIKE: No, that's not true.  It's the last book!  We're almost done! And 
      it can't possibly get any worse...

[Suddenly Mike breaks down crying.]

MIKE: Oh god, who am I kidding?  This is the most depraved work Ratliff 
      has ever done!  This fanfic makes me feel like the time when I was 
      nine and my weird cousin held me underwater for what seemed like an
      hour but was probably only a few minutes and my chest started hurting 
      real bad and I couldn't breathe and I could feel the pressure on my 
      skull and I was trashing around but he still wouldn't let me up and 
      I could feel until I started seeing spots and he finally let me up 
      and he thought it was funn-yyyyy...

[Tom and Crow have recovered and now are trying to comfort Mike.]

TOM: Aw, it's not the end of the world, Mike!
CROW: Yeah, we'll just keep on riffing and eventually we'll get through it!
MIKE: <sobbing> No!  Ratliff has scarred me for life!
TOM: Mike, you've been a pillar of strength throughout this fanfic.  Don't
     give up now!

[Mike does not respond.  Tom and Crow look at each other.]

CROW: Okay, we were hoping we wouldn't need this, but we made something
      just in case you snapped.
MIKE: What?
TOM: Reach underneath the counter there...

[Mike reaches underneath the counter and pulls out a doll.  The doll has
blond hair and is wearing a red Starfleet uniform.]

MIKE: What's this?
CROW: It's a Marrissa doll.
MIKE: Aaaagh!!

[Mike drops the doll and backs away, staring at it like a timid animal.]

TOM: No, no, Mike, it's okay!
CROW: Just pretend like it's a voodoo doll of Marrissa.  

[Mike walks back up to the counter and picks up the doll.]

MIKE: A voodoo doll?
TOM: Yeah!  Anything you do to that doll happens to Marrissa in real life!

[Apprehensively, Mike gives the doll and few jabs to the body.  He smiles.
Then he pinches the doll's head and starts talking like that guy on "Kids
in the Hall".]

MIKE: I'm squishing your head!  Squish!  Squish!
CROW: Starting to feel better, Mike?
MIKE: A little bit.  Hey, watch this!

[Mike bites the head off of the Marrissa doll.  As he spits out the head,
red "blood" spurts out of the doll's neck.  Tom and Crow cheer him on.]

MIKE: Oh, wow!  Real blood and everything!
TOM: Hey, Mike, try that stuff over there!
MIKE: Huh?  Oh, this stuff?

[Mike reaches off-screen and gets a container marked "Liquid Nitrogen".
He dips doll's legs into the container while Tom and Crow giggle in 
anticipation.  Then Mike slams the doll onto the counter.  The doll's  
lower half shatters into a million pieces.  Everyone cheers.  Then
the cheers and laughs die down.]

TOM: Oh, for fun.
MIKE: So what else can we do to this thing?

[Lights and buzzers go off.]

MIKE: It's gonna have to wait, cause WE GOT FANFIC SIGN!!!


6...5...4...3...2...1...*...

[They enter the theater.]

MIKE: See ya later, Marrissa!

[Mike throws the headless, legless doll across the theater.]

MIKE: I have to thank you guys.  That was very theraputic.
CROW: Null problemo, amigo!

>       "No girl has defeated me," Russel scowled.
>       "Think back three years," Marrissa said.  "You tried to capture

TOM: Has it really been three years since we started this fanfic?
CROW: Seems like it.

> It was forced down an a nearby plant.  The Pilot and co-Pilot were killed.  

MIKE: Thus beginning Marrissa's wholesale slaughter of the Trakce species.

CROW: Then Picard dropped his pants and mooned him!

TOM: That just leaves Admiral Necheyev she hasn't commanded.

>       "If you arem't challenging mem I'd like that braclet of yours,"
> Marrissa said sweetly.

MIKE: <Marrissa> It would look great with my red dress and pumps.

>       This infurreated the Ath 

CROW: A Trakcen Warewolf in London!

>                                and he rushed Marrissa.  She side
> stepped him and stuck out her foot.  

TOM: <Ath> Whoops, should've seen *that* one coming...

> The Ath tripped and fell knocking
> his head on a nearby console.  This left him dazed.

MIKE: This isn't "Star Trek" so much as "Road Runner".

>       "You won't mind me taking this will you?" Marrissa mutted
> removing the Trakce's bracelet.
>       "What is your command?" the helmsman asked of the young human

>       "Lower shields and prepare for my inspection party to beam

CROW: And thus, any sparks of dramatic tension are quickly extinguished.

> Turning to the viewscreen she

TOM: <Picard> Yeah.  Could you get him to stop kissing my feet?

> Send him

MIKE: <Marrissa> ...and me.

>       "Consider it done," her father replied.  "Anything else."
>       "Yes, bring me a uniform, I've been sitting in a wet swimming
> suit for the past five hours," Marrissa said.   

CROW: It hasn't dried yet?  She must be cold-blooded.

> "Lieutenant Picard out.

>                               Epilogue
>                               ~~~~~~~~

ALL: <much rejoicing>
TOM: Bring it on home, Ratliff!
MIKE: Our long national nightmare is over!  Well, almost...

>       After returning the Sutherland, the Polaris, and the Stargazer,

CROW: ...and being court-martialed for starship theft...

> and curing the crew of the Independence,  

TOM: ...with a wave of Marrissa's magic wand...

> Starfleet sent a runabout to
> take the former command crew of the Enterprise-D to their new ship.
> "Did you find out what ship we are getting?" Riker asked Captain Picard.

MIKE: <Riker> They never tell me anything.

>       "We will probably get a garbage scowl after losing the
> Enterprise," Geordi commented.
>       "Their are no garbage scowls currently in Starfleet," Data
> replied.

CROW: No, everybody's pretty damn perky, aren't they?

>       "Well, Captain?" Doctor Crusher asked after a moments silence.
> "What ship are we getting?"

TOM: I understand it's called the Andrea Doria.

>       "They just told me that our next mission is stellar survey of
> Sector 515," Captain Picard said.  

MIKE: <Picard> Then they told me to bring a spacesuit, and laughed.  How odd!

> "And that this runabout would take us
> to our new ship.  Then Admiral Necheyev sent me out while she talked to
> Marrissa."

CROW: <Picard> I caught the word "tampons"...

>       "So, it's a new ship then," Troi responded.
>       "Not necessarily, Counselor," LaForge replied.  "It may be a
> refit.
>       "Now entering spacedock," Marrissa announced. 
>       "Aren't you going to transfer control to Spacedock?" Riker
> asked.
>       "No, unlike yourself I know which ship is ours," Marrissa
> responded.

TOM: Having a vast spy network has its advantages.

>       "You know and you are letting us guess," Geordi said as they
> passed a Nebula class starship.

MIKE: <Marrissa> I love watching you squirm!

>       "Admiral Necheyev ordered me not to tell," Marrissa said
> piloting around an Intrepid class starship.  

CROW: So this is how Stafleet Command gets their thrills.  Whee.

> "Plus I enjoy listening to speculation."

TOM: <Marrissa> And thinking I'm better than you.

>       "And their is no way you are going to tell us," LaForge asked.
>       "No, What do you think of this one?" Marrissa questioned
> piloting around the rear of an Ambassador class starship.

MIKE: Her butt's too big.

>       "38 percent chance," Data replied.

CROW: Data, once and for all, SHUT UP!
TOM: That's all he does in this fanfic: generate odds!
MIKE: He'd be a hit in Vegas, at least.

>       "That so," Marrissa responded.  She then banked hard to the port
> It was now on coarse toward and Excelsior class starship.
>       "An Excelsior, we are going to get an Excelsior," Riker stated.

TOM: Hey!  This is the ending from "Star Trek IV"!
MIKE: Ratliff couldn't come up with an ending on his own, so he ripped 
      one off.
CROW: Well, at least he chose to plagarize one of the *good* films.

>       Marrissa then altered her coarse just a little and they passed
> between the port warp engine and the dorsal.  

TOM: She's possessed by the spirit of Catbert.

> In was now on coarse to a
> Galaxy class starship with a new style of warp engines.  "May be not
> then," Riker stated.

MIKE: May be later.

>       They as they neared the main shuttlebay they noticed that the
> name of the ship was covered with a large tarp.  

CROW: To protect it from the big storms in spacedock, I guess.

> When they came with in
> 25 meters of it, it began to be pulled into the main shuttlebay.  As it
> moved upwards the name Enterprise was revealed.  

MIKE: Everyone surprised by this? <nobody raises their hands>

> "Ladies in gentlemen, we are home," Captain Picard said.

TOM: <Picard> I stole Shatner's line, and I'm proud of it!
CROW: "Ladies in gentlemen"?  Isn't that usually the other way around?
MIKE: Crow!

>       As they landed in the shuttlebay Marrissa dead-panned, "How did
> that starship get in the way?"  The crew spun around to face her.  Then
> realizing that she was joking laughed.

CROW: Then Riker finally got a good shot at her.

> 
>       Arriving on the bridge of  the Enterprise NCC-1701-E, the crew
> took in their stations and the Captain checked his ready room.  "Number
> One order replacement panels for my walls," Picard said after taking a
> look at his office.

TOM: Number Six, I want information.

>       "Aye sir," Riker responded.  "What color is Starfleet trying
> now?"
>       "Pea-green walls with gold funature," Picard said.  

MIKE: Starfleet shouldn't have hired Ray Charles to decorate their ships.

> "Try to get some shade of blue panels and I will keep the funature.  

CROW: <Picard> And maybe some pink curtains, with a nice floral design...

> Data status of the crew?"

TOM: Bored stiff, sir.

>       "All 429 people are on board,"

MIKE: That's a long way from 1400 on the old Enterprise.
CROW: This crew is so inept, that's all Starfleet was willing to trust 
      them with.

>       "Marrissa take us out, best possible speed," Picard ordered
>       "Aye, sir, 37 percent impulse," Marrissa replied.
> 
> 

TOM: Not warp 9.999999999999999?      
MIKE: That's the best we can do until they give us the other warp nacelle.

CROW: So is that it?  Can we go?
TOM: No, no, wait a second.

TOM: <Ratliff> I have been informed I will be burning in hell for all
     eternity for writing them.

> Away From Home is a

MIKE: Three contacts? I guess they lost one and had to have it replaced.

> and minor

CROW: All that happened in such a... *long* time.

> The first part is set after the
> TNG episode "Imaganary Friend" and before any of my prevous stories.

TOM: Even Asimov couldn't write good pre-quels.

> The second part covers the peroid after Who Q? Where Q? intill the crash

>       As my fifth story it may require some reading of the other

MIKE: <pointing at "require"> You misspelled "encourage you to avoid like
      the plague".

> For instance some people are still inquiring how Marrissa got her rank.

CROW: She ate a lot of garlic.

> That is explained in Cadet Cruise and her promotion to

TOM: Bad.

> A Gul's Revenge

TOM: Worse.

TOM: Unknown.

TOM: Too horrible to contemplate.

CROW: AND WE'RE DONE!
ALL: YAY!!!
MIKE: Let's get out of here while we still can!

[Mike and the robots exit the theater.]

1...2...3...4...5...6...*...

[SOL.  Mike, Tom, and Crow are behind the counter.  There is a stack
of cardboard pieces on the counter.]

ALL: <breath a huge sigh of relief>
MIKE: Wow, that one was pretty rough.
CROW: Yep.  Yet another Ratliff epic down the drain.
TOM: It astounds me to think of how prolific this guy is, and he doesn't
     have a *clue* as to how much pain he's causing.
MIKE: That's a good point, there, Tom.  I mean, he's written five full
      Star Trek fanfics in only two years of college.
CROW: And we haven't even *seen* "Cadet Cruise" or "Who Q, Where Q" yet!
TOM: Shhhh!!
CROW: Oh yeah.  Sorry.
MIKE: Anyway, assuming that Ratliff graduates on time...
TOM: And considering the amount of work that goes into his fanfics, I'm
     sure he has plenty of time to study...
MIKE: ...that means he'll have written 10 fanfics by the time he graduates.
CROW: And that's assuming he doesn't do any graduate work!
TOM: Ugh.  That's too horrible to think about, Crow.
MIKE: Anyway, it looks like we have a *lot* of Ratliff to look forward to.
      So I thought it might be a fun thought exercise to speculate on
      the future of Ratliff's characters.
CROW: Um... why?
MIKE: Well, I got these cards made and everything, so...
CROW: Oh, all right.

[Mike's cards all have a name written on them.  He says the name as he
flips up each card.]

MIKE: <flips card> Marrissa Picard.
TOM: Like most child stars, Marrissa got burned out in the media spotlight.
     After achieving the rank of Grand Admiral at the tender age of 15,
     she turned to drugs and a life of crime.  She once again became the
     center of attention as she took control of a fully-armed battleship
     and slaughtered an entire species of peaceful, fun-loving aliens
     because they were wearing colored ribbons in their hair.  She was
     court-martialed and convicted, as the jury didn't buy her now-famous
     "PMS Defense."  She disappeared for a time, only to reappear in the 
     news years later by knocking over a liquor store on Starbase 121.
MIKE: <flips card> Clara Sutter.
CROW: Clara went to Starfleet Academy, but was never quite able to escape 
      the shadow of Marrissa Picard.  She did well in the Engineering
      program and wrote several more scientific essays that were not
      taken seriously by the few people who read them.  Her lone claim
      to fame was when she received the Wesley Crusher Award for being
      voted the nerdiest loser in her class.  She is currently living
      alone and afraid, surrounded by her only friends, 23 cats named 
      "Boo-Boo".
MIKE: <flips card> Shayna Sachs.
TOM: Killed in Vietnam.  Next?
MIKE: <flips card> Jay Gordon.
CROW: After his largely unsuccessful stint as acting-Captain, Jay decided
      that Starfleet was not for him.  He dropped out of the Kids Crew
      and joined an improvisational theater troupe called Fungus Amongus.
      He later went on to star in an off-Broadway version of "Mighty
      Morphin' Power Rangers," and found his greatest fame by playing Ben, 
      the wacky chief of security, in the hit comedy "Warp Factors Ahead!"
MIKE: <flips card> Ensign Najib Fahim.
TOM: After serving a two-year sentence for statutory rape, Fahim went on 
     to unsuccessfully run for Federation office.  He currently hosts his 
     own radio talk show.
MIKE: <flips card> The entire Trakce race.
CROW: The Trakce ended up being nothing more than a footnote in history,
      a race remembered for their astounding stupidity and complete 
      ineptitude, after Romulans invaded their homeworld.  While  
      attempting to fight off the invaders, the Trakcen ships got 
      confused when nobody could remember what color hair ribbons meant 
      what, so nobody knew who was in command.  The Romulans easily
      dispatched the Trakcen ships, and their race was completely
      wiped out.  This is often remembered as the Battle of Duuuhhhh...

[There is much giggling as Mike puts away his cards.  The Mads' light
begins flashing.]

MIKE: Whoops, Dr. Forrester is calling.  <he hits the light>  Hey, Dr. F,
      I guess that was the last Ratliff fanfic for a while, right?

[D13.  Forrester is close to the camera.]

DR.F: Don't count on it, Chris Crocker!  I've put my tendrils out on the
      Internet, and I *will* find the other Ratliff stories!  The pain
      has only *begun* to begin!   HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

[The dorrbell rings.  Forrester looks confused.]

DR.F: Who could that be?

[Forrester walks back to the vault door and opens it.  A stream of little
kids enter Deep 13.  They are aged about 5 to 10, and are all wearing
Starfleet uniforms.  The kids begin chasing each other, playing with
the lab equipment, shouting, laughing, and generally getting into everything
in the way that kids do.  Forrester looks aghast.  He looks even more
aghast as a blond-haired girl of about 13 years enters behind them.
She is also wearing a Starfleet uniform.]

MARRISSA: hi I'm Marrissa Picard.  Bow down before me, inferoir person.
DR.F: Now just wait a minute...
MARRISSA: I wood like to infrom you. that your lab will now be run by
	  my Kids' Crew.  Do you have a prblem with that, stuped Adult?
DR.F: But... but...

[The door opens again, and this time there are reporters on the other
side.  The reporters' camera flash.  Forrester begins slowly backing
away from the door, moving towards us.]

MARRISSA: Oh, how I hate the media.  i can never get away from the.
	  Okay, just a few picturres.

[Marrissa begins posing for their cameras.]

MARRISSA: Dont you just love me.  Aren't I the most adorable thing youve
	  ever seen?

[Forrester almost backs into the camera.  At the last second he turns
around.  His face is filled with fear.]

DR.F: Help... me...

[Forrester pushes the button.]
