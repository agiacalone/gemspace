Subject: MiSTied: revised "Battle for Bajor" (Part 1)

Hello, all.

This is my sixth MiSTing, but my first non Star Wars MiSTing.  I hadn't
planned on diverging from my theme, but the opportunity to grab a
Stephen Ratliff story was too good to miss.

For all those who are thinking this story had already been done, this is
a revised version of the original story.  Ratliff says that only 5% of
the original story is still here, so this is still good to go.  Please
send comments, questions or flames to me.  I can handle any of them.  

Enjoy,

Anthony Castellino

(Normal Season 6 opening credits)

0...2...3...4...5...6...*

(<SoL Bridge> It is empty, well almost empty.  It would be empty if not
for the large Vorlon standing in the middle, behind the table, just
looking at Cambot.  After a couple of seconds, Crow and Tom enter, Crow
from the left, Tom from the right.  They stop and do a double take,
looking at the Vorlon.)

CROW: Well, *that* certainly seems out of place here.

TOM: Oh, wow!  A Vorlon.  I always wanted to meet one of these.  (To the
Vorlon.)  How are ya'?

(The Vorlon is silent.)

TOM: Well, uh, come to the Satellite often?  Ain't this place so phony?

(The Vorlon remains silent.)

CROW: Not a very friendly critter, is it.  

VORLON: (Wind-chime, dog barking, car crashing noises) Friendly... is
irrelevant.

(The Bots jump.)

CROW: It speaks!

TOM: (Harsh whisper.) Don't anger it Crow.  (To Vorlon.)  Well, do you
have a name.

VORLON: (Blender, spell-checker noise, monkey howling) Kosh.

CROW: Oh, don't that just beat all.

TOM: Crow!  Hey, that's neat.  (Somewhat nervous.) Eh, I think I saw a
cousin of yours on TV once.  I believe his name was Kosh.

VORLON: (Pager, horn, cat meowing) We are all Kosh.

CROW (impatiently): That's nice.  (To Tom.) Look, Tom, if I may.  (To
Vorlon.) Mr. Kosh, if I may be so bold, I believe my colleague Tom Servo
would like to ask you, if he had a spine...

TOM: Hey!

CROW: ...is what the hell are you doing here?

(Crow flies backwards, as if hit by something.)

VORLON: (Door slamming, over-timer beeping, glass breaking) Impudent.

TOM (shaken): Uh, Mr. Kosh.  I apologize for my friend's rudeness, but
how can we help you?

VORLON: (Change jingling, bells going, whistling) I seek... the one...
called Nelson.

CROW: (Coming back on stage) Mike?  Jeeze, I haven't seen him for days.

TOM: Yeah, he hasn't come out of his room since... I would guess last
Thursday.

CROW: Yeah!  He that was the day...

TOM: The day TV's Frank smuggled that Sony Playstation up through the
Umbilicus for us...

CROW: And that copy of Final Fantasy VII.

MIKE (o.s.): How the hell do you beat this (censored) game!

CROW: He's still at it.  Probably still hasn't gotten off the first disk
yet.  I heard him yelling something yesterday about a
Yuffie-something...

TOM: (To Vorlon) As you can see, Mr. Kosh, our friend Mike has been,
well, pre-occupied for the past week or so.  In fact, I would dare to
venture that he hasn't eaten or slept since then.  I'd also imagine he's
lost a few million brain cells since then...

MIKE (o.s.): Damn you, Sephiroth!

TOM: So, um, if you would like us to leave him a message or something...

VORLON: (Cow mooing, meat slammers, volcano erupting.) If he goes to
Sephiroth... he will die.

(The Vorlon silently turns to the right and heads offstage, towards the
sound of Mike's voice and the corny Final Fantasy VII music.  A few
seconds later, a scuffle is heard.)

MIKE (o.s.):  Hey, what are you... Wait...  What are you doing!  Don't
touch that plug... Get away from there!  Give that back you giant
cycloptic trash compactor!

(The sound of an energy discharge is heard and the sound of what is
probably Mike being hurled into the wall.)

TOM (quietly): Oh, boy.

(The Vorlon returns onto the bridge.  It is carrying Mike's Playstation
and the box for the Final Fantasy CDs.  He continues off towards the
left.)

MIKE (o.s., weakly): Hey, wait.

(The Vorlon stops and turns back to face the direction of Mike's voice.)

VORLON: (Ice falling in a glass, knocking on wood, jingling.) You... are
not... ready.

(The Vorlon turns and leaves.  Mike can be heard groaning.  Commercial
light flashes.)

CROW (disgusted): Jeeze... 

TOM: We'll be right back.

(Commercials.)

(<Bridge of SoL> Mike has finally left his room after who knows how
long.  Needless to say, he looks like he could stand a shave and a
shower.)

CROW: *cough cough* Mike, I know you're in emotional turmoil and your
eyes haven't readjusted yet, but could you favor us and put on some
clean socks, *please!*

MIKE: (Rubbing his eyes, not comprehending what Tom said.) Wha... Oh
yeah, Tifa is kind of hot.

TOM: Just give him some time, Crow, he'll come out of it.

(Mad light starts to flash.)

MIKE: Well, nevermind. Shinra Incorporated is calling.

CROW: You sure about that, Tom.

TOM: Well, uh...

(Mike hits the mad light.)

(<Deep 13> It's the same old cluttered self.  Dr. Forrester is standing
in the middle while Frank, a little off to the left and behind him, is
playing with some sort of box.)

DR. F: Ah, Cloud and AVALANCHE, glad that you could join us today.
(Giggle's evily.)  You're not the only one to be addicted to a mind
numbing and highly frustrating game.  In fact, I plan to use a similar
concept myself to take over the world!  Unfortunately, not everyone can
shell out $250.00 for a game system and a game, so I've created one that
everyone can play, and cheaply...

<SoL>

TOM: Whatcha got there, Dr. F.

<Deep 13> 

DR. F: Well, it's simple, you mindless automaton!  I've taken the basic
geometric shape of a cube and turned it into a mind boggling puzzle. 
One that turns the brain inside out....

<SoL>

CROW: So, basically, you've re-invented the Rubix Cube?

<Deep 13>

DR. F:  Of course not.  What I have here puts that blindman's toy to
shame.  Mine is infinitely more challenging than that.  I've given the
prototype to Frank here about ten minutes ago to be a test subject.  I
imagine that within a frustrating week of no progress, Frank's brain
will turn to jelly and he'll bow before me with simple ease.

TV's FRANK: (Looking up triumphantly and holding out the box, solved.)
Finished Steve.

(Dr. Forrester has enough time to give a frustrated and angry look
before the whole lab goes dark, save for a light around Dr. F and
Frank.  In fact, you cannot see Deep 13 anymore.  They look around a bit
before a light slowly fades in behind them, revealing Pinhead from the
"Hellraiser" movies, sipping a cup of tea.)

PINHEAD (annoying British, nasal accent): Oh, goodie!  Visitors.  It's
been so long since we've had visitors.  May I offer you a cup of tea?

DR. F: Da' Hell?

PINHEAD: Exactly!  You're a bright boy!  (Pinches his cheek.  Looking
up, he sees Mike and the Bots.)  Oh, and you brought friends, too.  How
wonderful.  How are you today?

(<SoL> Confused looks are rampant.)   

CROW: Uh, fine, I guess.  And you are...?

<Dark Room>

PINHEAD: (Stepping out from between the confused Dr. F. and Frank.)  Oh,
how rude of me not to introduce myself.  Where are my manners?  My name
is Pinhead, and I'm a Cenobite.  And I'll be your tour guide through
Hell...

<SoL>

ALL: Hell!

MIKE: But, I've done nothing wrong.  Well, save for that hentai website
I made.

TOM: And your patronage of "Kindred: the Embraced."

MIKE: Yeah, well, that too...

CROW: And voting for Pat Buchanan.

MIKE: The mads made me do that!

TOM: What about the rumor that you enjoyed "Star Trek V."

MIKE: Okay, okay!  I admit it!  But I'm not dead yet.

<Dark Room>

PINHEAD: True, true.  But Frank here, this dear boy, opened the box,
hence summoning me.  Now, Hell's constitution says in Section III,
Paragraph VIII that all those who open the box must come here and suffer
eternal damnation.  I know, that sucks, but I don't make the rules. 
Now... (Turning to Dr. F. and Frank.)  Before your damnation starts, can
I give you a tour?  Yes, oh good.  (Turning back to Mike and the Bots.) 
But, since tours are limited, you can start your damnation right away. 
The big S-man down here has been bugging me to test market this new
release from his most biggest fan, Stephen Ratliff...

<SoL>

ALL: Stephen Ratliff!  NOOOOOO!

TOM: Just send us straight into the fires of Malebolge.

<Dark Room>

PINHEAD:  Sorry, there's a waiting list for that.  Now go into that
theater of yours and watch this most excellent piece of torture. 
(Turning to the Dr. F. and Frank and escorting them away.)  Now, I was
think pastels.  What do you think...?

(<SoL> The lights and alarms are going wild.)

ALL: We've got Stephen Ratliff sign.  Abandon all hope...

(They exit.)

*...6...5...4...3...2...0

(They enter and sit down.)

TOM: Somehow, I always knew 'ole Stephen had fans down here.

MIKE: Quiet now.  We may earn brownie points out of here if we're good
to him.

(Pause.)

ALL: Nah!

>Star Trek : The Next Generation

MIKE: A generation of pretty boys and hardbodies.

TOM: Except for when you see Riker running down the hall.  Then he looks
like Homer Simpson.

CROW: You know, I have to wonder what Hell could possibly throw at us
after surviving "The Only Constant"?

>Battle For Bajor
>(revised version)
>By Stephen Ratliff 

CROW: I had to ask.

TOM: Wait a minute!  We've already read this one.

MIKE: Uh, Tom, it says "revised version."

TOM: Oh, I see.  AHHHHH!

CROW (croaking): Liberate et-tu me...

>A revision of his story A Gul's Revenge
>A story in the Marrissa Stories 

TOM: A redundancy in the redundancy.

>Our Story thus far . . .

ALL: (Making the "Wayne's World" flashback noise and Mike is making the
appropriate hand gestures.)

>(Enterprized) 
>	The Enterprise-D under Captain Jean-Luc Picard has been ordered
>to time travel into the past

MIKE: Where time keeps on slipping into the future.

>			        to retrieve the Enterprise-C from the
>Romulans, who plan to use it for some plan of their own.

MIKE: And the plan to make plans for part of their plans for their
plans... oh, forget it.

>							           Toward that
>end Captain Picard has taken an inventor of a new cloaking device
>aboard, Wesley Crusher.  

TOM (Picard): Dear God, why me?

>	The cloaking device however could not encompass the whole ship
>so the saucer will had to be left behind.

CROW: Must have been designed during the eighties.  Things didn't work
so well then. 

>					       However the Captain needed
>all the personnel he can get so he could take and crew the Enterprise-C.
>Wesley suggests the Enterprise's Kid's Crew, 

MIKE: They laugh at him for it, thinking it a joke at first.  But then
awing silence fills the room as the creeping realization that he was
serious descends upon them like specter... 

>						     a club of children who do
>missions on the holodeck.

CROW: "Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?" does not count as
mission training!

MIKE: Easy, Crow.

>			          Captain Picard agrees after hearing that the
>leader of the Kid's Crew, an almost twelve year old girl who had gotten
>trapped in a turbolift a couple years back with the Captain named
>Marrissa Flores, had a twenty-plus Kobayashi Maru time, which is
>considered exceptional and in fact is the record by about a minute.

MIKE: Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Stephen, stop and take a breath.  No need to
rush.

CROW: What, you *want* to take your time with this?

MIKE: Oh, yeah.  Nevermind.

>	After Ambassador Spock arrives, the Enterprise stardrive departs
>for Romulus and the saucer for Deep Space Nine.

TOM: Okay, Stephen's gone from present, to past, and back to present
tense again.  Make up your mind!

MIKE: It can wait, count to twenty.

TOM: One...two...three...four...

MIKE: In Greek.

TOM: Funny!

>	The Enterprise stardrive traveled back in time and rescued both
>the Enterprise-C and Lieutenant Tasha Yarr.

MIKE: Wow!  Time travel.  Something completely different.

TOM (disgusted): Not!

>						  Meanwhile

CROW: ...in beautiful Skokie, Illinois...

>							          the saucer
>encountered a Cardassian warship deep in Federation space, which
>Marrissa disabled and engraved the phrase,

TOM: "All hail the West Side Connection."

>					            'I was beaten by a bunch of
>kids' in their hull.

CROW: Oh, Marrissa's Sailor Moon all of a sudden.

>	The Enterprise-C and the Enterprise-D stardrive returned to
>Federation space by way of Captain Kirk's time.

MIKE: These words put together in that order make no sense, Steve.  

>						         A Romulan warbird
>screamed a cross

CROW (screaming): Jesus died for your sins, child!

PINHEAD (v.o.): There'll be none of that, thank you.

>		       the neutral zone demanding the return of the
>Enterprise-C.  They were placated by the return of their captured

MIKE: And with snowcones.

>	Meanwhile the Enterprise-D saucer section was had a hard time

CROW: The Teamsters were picketing.

>		   and the Cardassian Commander had an even harder time
>getting his demands across.

TOM (drive-thru voice): I'm sorry, could you repeat your order please?

MIKE (Cardassian): Forget the burger!  All I really want is a Pepsi.

>			             The Enterprise-D stardrive and the
>Enterprise-C set a coarse for Deep Space Nine but the Enterprise-D
>stardrive got delayed by a damaged Ferengi ship.
>. . . the story continues . . .

CROW: Unfortunately.

>Prologue

TOM: Again?! 

>	It had not been Gul Ducat's week.

CROW: The fact that the Central Command couldn't spell his name right
had him slightly miffed.

>					       Everything had started when he
>was assigned to attack Earth.  The force had been ordered to proceed
>across the border separately.

TOM (singing): With or without reason... 

>				  They were suppose to met in the graveyard
>of ships at Wolf 359.

MIKE: And dig them up as a Halloween gag on the Fedies.

>			  Of the 30 ships, only 10 had made it and those
>were quickly defeated by a Star Fleet Taskforce lead by the starship
>Hood.  

CROW: Starships in tights.

TOM: Tight tights!

>	Gul Ducat's Akane had the distinction of being the first of
>those ships to be captured.

MIKE (Dukat): Am I good or what?  Who's the king... Wait a minute, this
is bad! 

>			           The Akane had left a Miranda Class starship
>drifting lifeless in its wake by the time it encountered the Enterprise
>saucer section.  It had looked like an easy target.

ALL (singing): I'm alone and an easy target...

>						        A saucer section
>crewed by a bunch of children.  How much could they do?

MIKE: Ever see "Village of the Damned"?

>	Plenty it had turned out.

CROW: They burned off his hair with a blowtorch, smashed his head with
an iron, threw a paintcan in his face...

>				    He still wasn't sure how they had
>evaded fire and disabled first his engines, then his weapons, and
>finally his shields.

TOM: They were using the Heart of Gold's improbabilty drive.

>		          That wasn't what grated his soul

CROW: ...over a plate of pasta.

MIKE: Losing to Marrissa is like masturbating with a cheese grater,
slightly amusing but mostly painful.

>							    an made him cry
>out for revenge, though.

TOM: It was the constant delay and lack of public consideration by Rhino
Records that did that.

>			        It was the inscription the young girl in
>command had carved with her phasers on the Akane's hull.  An inscription
>that no one could seem to remove.

TOM: Oh please, it's an ingraving!  It's not like it's the friggin mark
of the beast.

>	"I was beaten by a bunch of kids." 
>
>xvb
>Chapter One

MIKE: Scene Four.

TOM: "Angels and ministers of grace, defend us."

PINHEAD (v.o.): Next one to say something like that, and I'll substitute
this story for nude pictures of Louis Anderson.

ALL: We'll be good.

PINHEAD (v.o.) *ahem*

MIKE: In a figurative sense.

>        Marrissa stood by the window in the Captain's Ready Room.

CROW (Marrissa): My God, there's a man on the nacell!

>									  While
>she wasn't crying at the moment, she had been.  Her parents were dead.

TOM: Her long oppressive nightmare of nine o'clock bedtimes and brussle
sprouts was over.  She was now free to roam and rule the galaxy at her
whim.

>She was avoiding going to her quarters.  There were just too many
>memories haunting the place.

MIKE: "Rihsab."

CROW: I thought we agreed never to mention "The Haunted" ever again.

>			               Since the Ready Room was her domain

TOM (Marrissa): Help!  I'm trapped in AOL.

>									        until
>Captain Picard returned with the stardrive, the twelve year-old girl
>stayed there most of the time,

MIKE: Picard caught her drinking and dancing on a table in Ten-Forward
and grounded her good!

>				  next to the bridge of the ship she was
>commanding.  A ship that she had been so proud to command that she had
>never said good-bye.

CROW (confused): I'll take your word for it.

>        Marrissa didn't know what she'd do when Captain Picard returned.

TOM (Homer Simpson): I'm going to get really drunk and party all night!

>With her parent's deaths she had lost everything, a mother, a father, a
>home, the stars.

MIKE: People must have gotten tired of praying for George Bailey. 

>		      She'd always dreamed of commanding a starship.  Now
>after obtaining that dream for a short while, she had lost it all.

CROW: Saaayyyy...

MIKE: Knock it off, Crow.

>								       Now
>she was destined to be sent off the ship to some foster home.  If she
>every go command again it would be of a freighter, most likely.

TOM: If the audience is lucky, she'll get the Event Horizon.

>								        What
>was she kidding herself, if she ever got IN a starship again it would be
>as a passenger.  

CROW: We could only wish.

TOM: This is not my beautiful starship!

>        "But you want something more," Troi prompted after a moment's

MIKE: What, she had to think about that?

TOM: Even in text format, I can see the "tilt" sign flashing on Troi's
head right now.

CROW: The replicator, his wife.

CROW: He's sulking like Achilles in his tent.

>        "What about your nephew Rene?" Troi asked.  "From what you've
>told me, he's interested in Star Fleet."

TOM: Uh, Stephen, remember a movie called "Generations"?

MIKE: This was written before that.

TOM: But this is a revision.

MIKE: Good point.

MIKE (Picard): He's dead.  Oh, yeah.

>        "... Plus what?"
>        "Counselor, have you ever read James T. Kirk's logs?"

ALL: Eww!

TOM: Biblically?

>        "In one of them following the Genesis Incident, he states that

want?

MIKE (Picard): Chick bait.

TOM (Yarr): Um, how do you turn off the self-destruct?

>"Priority One call for assistance from Deep Space Nine.  They are

MIKE: And the caterers haven't arived yet!

CROW (Picard): And get me a bowl of Fruit Brute.

TOM (Sisko): There's still that issue over the twenty bucks you owe from
our Superbowl bet.

>        "About a year," Picard responded.  "I hear you have Cardassians

MIKE: Congratulations.

>        "A dozen, ETA one hour fifty minutes," Sisko responded.  "I

CROW (Picard, sarcastically): No, I was calling to find out if you have
any tickets for "Rent."  Whadda' think I'm calling for, you ninny.

CROW (singing): She's the reason, the reason I can't sleep at night.

ALL: *sigh*

MIKE (laughing): You have *got* to be kidding me!

CROW: We're Marines.  We don't plan, we improvise!

background.) 

TOM (Odo): We really need to start putting bars on the prison doors,
sir.

(<SoL Bridge> Crow and Tom are just standing there.)

CROW: You know, I've been thinking...

TOM: That's new for you.

CROW: And I was wondering, it's clearly obvious that the next step for
Stephen to take Marrissa is godhood.

TOM: Not much else left.  We've already seen her become an admiral, in
charge of all Kids Crews in Starfleet, and even an heir to a planet's
throne.  And lets not forget the countless awards and ceremonies she
graciously accepted for all good citizenship.

CROW: If slaughtering Romulans on a holocaust level counts as good
samaritanship, yes.

TOM: But what's your point, Crow.

CROW: Well, I'm just trying to picture what Marrissa's ascension into
the heavens would be like.  There would have to a great visual affect to
it.

TOM: Goes well with the motive.

CROW: But what would it be like?

TOM: Well, since she would probably reign over all the pain and chaos in
the universe, her apotheosis would be surrounded with dark imagery. 
Let's see...  Oh, I got it.  The dead would rise and feast on the
living.  The unborn would claw their way out of their mother's wombs. 
Panic and terror would dominate the streets of every city on the world. 
And meanwhile, Marrissa, standing there amongst the carnage and
surrounded by a circle of fire, would give out a laugh sounding like all
the screams in a White Zombie CD, would then be engulfed by a column of
pure darkness.  Then a terrific explosion would take place for miles
around, raining fallout and bodies all throughout the countryside.  But
we would see Marrissa, unfazed, with her ponytail unsinged, taken up
into the cosmos by some creatures that came straight from a Gary Gygax
book cover.  You think?

(Crow just stares at him for a moment.)

CROW: You are really twisted, you know that?

(Alarms go off.)

BOTS: Fanfic sign!  Oh no!

*...6...5...4...3...2...0

(They enter the theater.)

MIKE: So, what were you guys talking about just then?

CROW: A compelling argument for agnosticism.

>        Jay Gordon entered.  He'd been up and commanding the Enterprise
>for two hours.  "Good Morning Marrissa,"

MIKE (Marrissa): Good morning, HAL.

>a PADD with the latest ship updates.  

CROW (Jay): That flaming decal you wanted painted on is going to run
another five hundred...

>        "How can you be so cheerful at 0750 hours?" Marrissa asked,

ALL: Prozac!

>taking the PADD as she walked over to the replicator.  "One tall glass
>of orange juice

MIKE: Orange juice?  She must have given up the strawberry juice for
Lent.

>		   and a bowl of rice krispies with two percent milk and
>sliced strawberries.  Do you want anything, Jay?"

TOM (Jay): Yeah, but it's not on the menu... Oh.

>        "No I already ate," Jay responded.  "Commander Sisko needs us to
>evacuate the civilians of Deep Space Nine, fast."
>        "Can you and Clara handle it?" Marrissa asked.  "It looks like I
>better work on contingency plans."

CROW (Marrissa): Or I could just shed my mortal coil and use my fully
divinity... Nah, too easy. 

>        "I think so, but you might need Clara," Jay said.
>        "It will be an hour before I get far enough to need her,"
>Marrissa said.  "Get to work, Jay."

MIKE: Jawohl, meine Fuhrerin!

>
>        Clara Sutter beamed up the first people from Deep Space Nine.

TOM: It was *wonderful*.

>Among them was Keiko and Molly O'Brien, and Jake Sisko.  "Mrs. O'Brien,

CROW: Can I interest you in a set of flobies?

>Jake can you assist me?" Clara asked.
>        "What can we do?" Keiko asked.

MIKE (Clara): Well, Marrissa has demanded an altar built to her by 1200
hours and a blood sacrifice...

>        "Do you know how to operate a transporter?" Clara inquired.
>        "Yes, you don't have an engineer for a husband without learning
>something," Keiko replied. 

TOM (Keiko): I learned that sponges can be used in a variety of ways.

>        "Then you can beam people aboard and Jake can assign them
>quarters," Clara ordered.  "I've got to check on the docking port.  When
>you are done, let Jake take Molly to your quarters, you got your old
>ones, and report to the bridge.  Marrissa wants to see you."

CROW: The look of dread that must have just crossed Keiko's face...

MIKE & CROW: (Yelling as if falling down a shaft.)

ALL: BWHAHAHAHA!

MIKE (Molly):  You know nothing.  Shut up, puny adult!

>        "Quark you where supposed to leave here an hour ago," Odo said.

CROW (Odo, desperate): Come on, go.  I wanna score with Kira tonight...

TOM: Hey, who doesn't.

>As this did not move the Ferengi he continued.  "The Enterprise is
>waiting for you, Quark."
>        "Let them go, I'm staying here," Quark said.

MIKE (Quark): I can't miss the season premier of "ER."

>        Jake Sisko, Jay Gordon and Alexander beamed into Quark's.  "How
>can we help you, Odo?" Jay asked.

CROW (Odo): By jettisoning yourself into the void.

>        "Mr. Quark and his family don't want to leave," Odo said.
>        "I don't see that he has any choice," Jay Gordon said.

TOM: As he withdrew a lead pipe.

>motioned for Jake to go around the Ferengi and tapped his communication
>lightly.  Jake moved around and behind the Ferengi.

MIKE (Jake): So Quark, ever see "Deliverance"?

>        "Quark apparently disagrees," Odo said. "Not that it would help
>him."

TOM: Did we step into mob movie all of a sudden?

>        "Help him," Rom said.  All eye were on Jay, Odo, and Alexander
>who was standing between the two.
>        "The way I see it you either go with these gentlemen, or ...,"

CROW: As Odo put on some brass knuckles.

TOM: We don't have a bridge.

CROW: No bridge?

TOM: Just a tower.

CROW: Why the hell aren't I notified about these things?!

MIKE: Ladies and gentlemen, the "Airplane II" skit.

CROW: Slightly reversed.

MIKE: Statutory beamup.  Five to ten.

>        "To who Quark?" Jake asked.  "Odo certainly isn't going to do

TOM: He's a Chicago cop.

>        "To this ship's chief of security," Quark replied.
>        "The Klingon kid is the security chief," Jay said.

would be the senior captain *anywhere*?

it's just been the Satellite of Love and this god-awful story.

It's probably quite different down there.

MIKE: It was designed to look like a giant eggbeater.

TOM: When the enemy ship explodes, logic dictates that the enemy loses.

CROW: Logically.

MIKE: He was sleeping with his commanding officer.

TOM: AM or PM?

>					  Riker hadn't expected so many

CROW: Riker, on the other hand, was choosen for his *ahem* "exploratory"
experience.

MIKE: *laugh*

>						  The wormhole and the
>station were of much more strategic importance.

TOM: The station had a bar.

>						        So he and Captain
>Szustakowski of the Roanoke had to deal with three ships each.  Now the
>Roanoke was a Nebula only two weeks off the line, but the Enterprise-C
>was a fifty year old ship which hadn't been refit for over thirty.

CROW: See, Ratliff likes to point out all of Starfleet's disadvantages
so that more people will bow down and worship Marrissa when she saves
their sorry asses.

MIKE: Easy Crow, don't let anger grow.

CROW: Oh shut up, Yoda.

>								        Add
>to that the fact that Riker was use to a more powerful ship and his crew
>was the Enterprise-D's second string, and you had potential problems.

MIKE: Who, me?  Hey, leave me out of this.

>However this was the flagship's second string team, and Riker had played
>the underdog before.

TOM: Who's narrating this?  John Madden?

>        He knew that the Cardassians would do a double take when they
>saw the Enterprise-C, a ship who hadn't been seen since 2345, more than
>twenty years ago.  They'd remember her,

MIKE: She was the weird bucktooth chick with no ears.

>					         the flagship of the fleet that
>had lead Star Fleet to defeat them in the First Cardassian war.  It was
>a ghost from their past, still gleaming with it's original paint style.

CROW: Lime green with gold decals.

MIKE: I'd do a double take too if I saw that.

>"Mister Worf, open fire," Riker ordered.
>        Riker's fire caught the Cardassians not yet prepared.

ALL: WHAT?!

TOM: Are Cardassians an anagram for Iraqis?

>								  Their
>shields were still coming up and none of their weapons were ready, when
>Rikers barrage of torpedoes impacted their forward shields.  The Roanoke
>followed the strike with a run above the Cardassian line, striking each

CROW: More pay!  Less hours!

MIKE & TOM: Union!  Union!

>			  By the time the Cardassian warships returned

MIKE: Whatever.

TOM: Assignment: Miami Beach.

>        Around Bajor, the early attacks of the Roanoke and Enterprise-C
>had blunted the six Cardassian warships,

CROW (little kid): You overused my Cardassian warship crayon.

>					       but that in itself would not be
>enough to defeat them.

MIKE: There still has to be a justification for Marrissa's involvement
in this story. 

>			     The six Cardassians quickly evened up the ship's

CROW: Hello?  Steve, what the hell are you talking about?

MIKE (announcer): Ford introduceds it's ltest line in brand new Bajoran
Assaultcraft.

BOTS (singing): Like a rock...

CROW: Bajorans are masochistic.

>        At first it looked like a losing battle.

MIKE: But just a little while ago Star Fleet was mopping the floor with
the Cardassians.  

TOM: Yeah, Steve.  Hire a continuity supervisor next time.

>					         Even with the Bajoran
>forces, Star Fleet was still weaker.  Then the new starship Intrepid
>arrived.  She was only a scout, but she was top of the line, fresh out

TOM: Drunk.

>        The final straw for the Cardassians was the starship Hood.

MIKE: A real rough section of the galaxy.

>out one warship within his first minute in the battle.

CROW (DeSoto): Sorry I was late.  I was busy discovering the Grand
Canyon.

>							  Riker smiled at

>of the battle, still unleashing torpedoes as she passed.

TOM: Unfortunately, it's a German airshow so the Hood exploded and
crashed.

>        The Cardassians reacted, turning toward the newcomer who had
>flaunted its destruction of their comrade in arms.

MIKE (Hood): Nyah nyah ny nyah nyaaaaah. 

>						         They set after the
>Hood, for the moment ignoring her fellow Star Fleet and Bajoran vessels.
>Riker noticed a particularly tasty target,

CROW (Homer Simpson): Mmmm.  Targets.

>					      and ordered the Enterprise-C

TOM (Beavis): Fire!  Fire!  Cool.

MIKE: I wet 'em.

TOM (first officer): They want to make a run for the border, sir.

MIKE (Dukat): I suggest you shut up.

CROW (Dukat): After all, my pride is more important than all of your
lives.

MIKE: Stock market prices on Apple were up 2 1/2 points.

MIKE: Oh!  That's cold.

Cardassians to eat her warp field!

return in thirty years...  Oh wait, am I thinking of the wrong

Newsgroups: rec.arts.tv.mst3k.misc
Subject: MiSTied: revised " Battle for Bajor" (Part 4)

(<SoL>All are on the bridge.)

TOM: Say, guys.  What do you think the Battle of Armageddon will look
like?

MIKE: What?

TOM: Well, since witnessing the greatest Ratliffian battle-scene ever,
and considering are present location, I got to wondering what that
ultimate battle between good and evil will look like?

CROW: Hey, maybe needleface could answer that.

MIKE: I don't know if that's a good idea...

BOTS: Oh, come on.  Please.

MIKE: Well... kay!

(He hits the Mad/Hell light.)

(<Hell> They're at a giant file cabinet in a "room.")

PINHEAD: ...and let's look at your record, Dr. F.  (Pulls out a huge
drawer).  Hmm, number of times you've shared the gospel is rather low. 
However, the number of times you've watched "Showgirls" is rather
high...  (Looks up.)  Ah, my playmates.  Can I help you?  Care for some
tea?

<SoL>

MIKE: Ah, no thank you.  But we just had a question.  Do you have any
plans for the Battle of Armageddon.

CROW: Yeah, are Macintosh and PC users going to face off?

<Hell>

PINHEAD: Oh, I can' tell you that.  That's top secret.  (Thoughtful
pause.)  However, we do have a couple of field agents about to set forth
Hell's mission of evil and destruction.  I suppose you could see that.

(Pinhead snaps his fingers and the image fades.  We are now looking at a
satellite few of earth.  With a snap, the image get closer and closer to
earth.  We zoom in on North America, then the US, then California, then
LA.  We now see an aerial shot of a building with many people going into
it.  With another snap, we are now seeing the inside of the building. 
It's a Star Trek convention.  Amongst all the loyal fans, one auspicious
looking character dressed in black weaves through the crowd.  He
approaches the center of the crowd and gets on a podium, where the guest
speaker would normally speak, and takes the microphone.)

MIB: Everybody, please listen, this is an emergency.  

(Everyone stops to listen.)

MIB: I just came by from the Babylon 5 conference down the street.  And
you wouldn't believe what I heard.

(Murmuring can be heard from the crowd.)  

MIB: They said that Deep Space Nine is just a rip-off of their series!

(Shocking gasps.)

MIB: They said that Rick Berman is the anti-christ and blows in
comparison to J. Mike Straczynski.  And they said that if we had
half-decent writers, we wouldn't be canceling after this season.

(Anger is boiling in the crowd.)

MIB: According to them, we have no sense of continuity and cheap
dialogue.

(Hateful words are heard from the crowd.)

MIB: They said the Shadows could kick the Dominion's butt and still
conquer the Federation, and it was just a cop-out for the Prophets to
destroy that Dominion fleet.

("No way!" is heard from the crowd.)

MIB: (Harsh whisper.)  And you know what else they said?  (Voice rises
to evangelical levels.)  They said Delenn was hotter and better than Dax
*and* Kira put together!

(The crowd is in a frenzy now.)

MIB: Are we going to tolerate that!

CROWD: NO!

MIB: Then lets go get 'em!

(The crowd rushes out the door.  A small, sinister smile can be seen on
the man in black.  We see them charging down the street to the Babylon 5
conference.  They smash through the door, and a huge blood letting
begins.  Soon we see images of the riot police and the nation guard
coming in to quell the violence.  Needless to say, it's not pretty.  The
image then distorts back to Pinhead in Hell.)

PINHEAD: Does that answer your question?

<SoL>

TOM: Well, I don't know.  Is Babylon 5 actually supposed to be the side
of goodness?

(Alarms go off.)

ALL: Fanfic sign!

*...6...5...4...3...2...0

(They all enter the theater.)

TOM: I just have a hard time picturing either of those groups as the
good guy.

>Chapter Six

MIKE: The Curse of Michael Meyers.

>        The funeral for Marrissa's parents was held after the battle.
>Like many Star Fleet Officers, Marrissa's parents had chosen to be shot
>into the nearest star, after their death.

CROW: Well I'd *hope* they would wait until then.  Be kind of cruel,
otherwise.

>					  So a special torpedo
>launching rig had been set up in the main shuttle bay.  The whole
>command crew attended in dress uniforms.  Marrissa's Crew also came,
>dressed in new uniforms.  

TOM: Yeah, Cub Scout uniforms.

>        Marrissa stood, all alone to the right of her father's
>casket/torpedo casing.

CROW: Casket!

TOM: Torpedo!

CROW: Casket!

TOM: Torpedo

MIKE (announcer): Calm down, you two.  It's a casket and a torpedo.

>			  Her face was expressionless, her eyes red.

CROW: She was hammered.

>								          She
>wore a plain black dress, as black as she felt.

TOM: In fact, she was black and proud.

>						    Marrissa stared at
>though open Shuttlebay doors at the stars.  

MIKE: And exploded from the depressurization.

>        It came time for the speeches before Marrissa's parents bodies
>were committed to the stars.  First was her parent's commanding officer,
>Lieutenant Worf.  He began,

CROW (Worf, singing): When you attend the funeral, it is sad to think
that sooner... or later that those who love you will do the same for
you...
 
>				 "George and Margaret Flores were two of the
>best officers under my command.  George was an eager swordsman

TOM (Worf): A real ass-kisser, actually.

>									   with his
>broadsword, a useful skill to have around even on a starship.  Margaret
>was my best precision shooter.

MIKE: There is disturbing Freudian language in this speech.

>				      Together they had served on the
>Enterprise since before it was commissioned.

BOTS: How?

MIKE: Don't you remember?  Ratliff established that they worked on the
construction of the Enterprise in previous stories. 

CROW: Oh, thanks a lot, Mike!

>						  I often wondered why they
>had chosen a life as security officers on a starship, which is not the
>safest occupation, especially with a child.  I wondered if perhaps it
>was the same as my reason.

TOM: A mutual hatred for their offspring?

>				  It was not, but it was an honorable one.

MIKE: They enjoyed killing.

>Lieutenant Flores responded with a poem, which he said, although it was
>written about the sea, it applied to the stars just as well.  At his
>request, I will read that poem now.

ALL: *laugh*

TOM: Worf, reading *poetry*?

MIKE: Well, he did once for Dr. Polatski.

BOTS: Fanboy!  Fanboy!

>Sea Fever 
>by John Masefield

CROW (John Masefield): Leave my work out of this!

>I must go down to the sea again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
>And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;
>And the wheel's kick and wind's song and the white sail's shaking,
>And a gray mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking.

TOM (heckler): You're not funny!

>I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide,
>It is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;

MIKE: This has all the warmth of a White Zombie song.

>And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
>And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.

CROW: Poisoned bread crumbs!

>I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
>To the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted
>knife;

TOM (mumbling): Hacks this story to pieces.

>And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow rover,
>And a quiet sleep and sweet dream when the long trick's over.
>
>        Worf yielded the podium,

MIKE (singing): And we'll all drop our agendas and adjourn. 

>				    to another officer, as one by one
>Marrissa's parents's comrades told about how they knew the Flores, and
>what they meant to them.

CROW: Must have been really short speeches, then.

>			        Though it all Marrissa stood expressionless,
>staring at the stars.  Occasionally a tear would streak down her check,
>unacknowledged.

TOM: Who mourns for Marrissa?

MIKE: I think we reached our obscurity quota with that one.

>		          Finally Captain Picard took the podium.
>        "Today we gathered here to do one of the saddest duties of Star
>Fleet Officers, to bury our dead," Picard began.

CROW (Picard): Do you know how hard it is to dig up this titanium
flooring?

>						         "It is a duty I have
>done many times in the course of my career, and it never gets easier.

TOM: SATs are a bitch, aren't they. 

>Nor should it, especially when a child loses both of her parents.  I was
>mentor to their child, Marrissa, and though that relationship,

BOTS: That's sick!

MIKE: Guys! 

>								   I got to
>know George and Margaret Flores.  George was a master swordsman, who
>taught his daughter, his little Princess very well.

TOM: Funny, she doesn't look Drewish.

>						          Margaret was an
>outdoors woman

CROW: Nearly got her killed many times when she tried walking out of the
airlocks.

>		        who enjoyed camping and insisted that her family go
>camping every time they went on shore-leave.  They both wanted to serve
>in Star Fleet, to serve in the stars, like the rover in Masefield's poem
>wanted to go to sea.

MIKE: More like in the "Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner."

>        "Well their long shift on board is over," Picard concluded.

CROW: I'll bet it was the graveyard shift.

MIKE: Oh, jeeze Crow.

>								         "I
>hope they got their merry tale and now are enjoying quiet sleep and
>sweet dreams as we commit their bodies to the stars."
>        At that, Commander Riker raised a trumpet and began playing

TOM: "Night Bird"?

>"Taps."  Two pairs of security officers folded up the Star Fleet banners
>which had been draped over the torpedo casings and handed them to
>Marrissa.

CROW (security officer): Take it, we don't want it anymore.

>	         Marrissa was now staring at the casings as they moved out of
>the shuttlebay, tears flowing down her cheeks.
>        As the last note echoed in the bay, Marrissa fled it.  Counselor
>Troi attempted to follow, only to lose the running girl. 

TOM: Marrissa's the Predator.

>
>        Captain Picard was going over the repair lists for the stardrive
>and saucer sections.  Some damage on the docking system on the stardrive
>section was preventing the reunification of the Enterprise.

MIKE: Like Bosnia.

>							           The saucer
>was reporting stressed aft shields, no wonder there,

TOM: They hadn't had a vacation in months.

>							 and puzzling to
>Captain Picard a rear tractor beam unit burnt out.  The door chimed.
>"Come."

CROW: I imagine that's what he would sound like in bed with Dr. Crusher.

MIKE: Crow!

CROW: Heh-heh...

>        Counselor Troi entered, carrying a PADD.
>        "What can I do for you, Counselor?" Picard asked.

TOM (Troi): I need a tighter-fitting uniform.

>        "Captain, I was looking at the Flores' will," Troi began.  "Are
>you aware that you've been named Marrissa's guardian?"
>        "Yes," Picard replied quite serenely.

MIKE (Picard): Hand me my phaser.

>        "That means you are now responsible for her," Troi responded at
>her Captain's reaction.
>        "Counselor, I've run starships for almost 30 years, faced
>Klingons, Cardassians, Romulans, and Borg.  I hardly think one twelve
>year old girl could be much more trouble."

CROW: You can't even discern the difference between a British and a
French accent and you think raising a child is easy?.

>        "Captain, I think you better revise that.  Marrissa is a young
>girl who has suddenly lost both of her parents.  She has no living
>relatives she knows of.  She's scared.  She doesn't know what is going
>to happen to her."

TOM: At this rate, apotheosis. 

MIKE: Don't encourage him.

>        "Have you been to see her yet?"
>        "No, I prefer to know as much as possible about the situation
>before going in. I've talked to her friends Jay and Clara."
>        "And what did they say?" Picard asked.

CROW (Troi): Something about "redrum."

>						  Troi looked at Picard
>with a question in her eyes.  "If I'm going to adopt Marrissa, I better
>know what I'm getting into."

MIKE: Trouble.  Lots and lots of it.

>        "Pardon me, but what have you done with my Captain?" Troi asked.
>        "Have I finally managed to surprise you?" Picard inquired.
>        "Yes, Captain," Troi responded.  "I've seen nothing to indicate
>that you would do this."

TOM: Well, consult the script then.

>        "Counselor, ever since I came on board you've been trying to
>ease my discomfort with children.  You've asked me to give tours, had
>that 'Captain Picard Day', and even maneuvered me into taking
>Marrissa's Class on a field trip.

CROW (Picard): But the Nude Nurses Day, *that* was a good idea.

>				      And don't tell me about 'Commander
>Riker's so- called injury.'

MIKE: Don't tell *any* of us about that!

>				 I know all about it from Doctor Crusher.
>Well you've succeed.  I now enjoy my time with them.  That's why I
>decided to become a mentor."

CROW: Oh, is that what they call them now?

>        "Why did you choose Marrissa to mentor?" Troi asked.
>        "She asked me," Picard said simply.  "Afer her help back when I
>was trapped in the turbolift, she apparently started working on her
>proposal.  Then after that archeology field trip she presented it to me.

MIKE (Picard): I use it for a coaster.

>And by the way if it hadn't been for the fact the field trip was an
>archeology one, you might have gotten away with it.  In any case, it was
>an opportunity I didn't think I could pass up.

CROW (Picard): Me and Mel Gibson working together...

>						  Not many young ladies,
>especially ones as shy as Marrissa, get up the courage to ask a
>Starfleet Captain anything."

TOM: Mike, I'm going to have nightmares about this.

MIKE: It'll be okay.

>
>        Marrissa sat on a couch in her family's quarters.  On the coffee
>table was a half filled packing crate.  In her lap was a picture of her
>dead parents.  Marrissa's eyes were filled with tears.  If you listened
>carefully you could hear her soft sobs punctuated by an occasional
>snuffle.

CROW: That's one weird seashell.

>        The door chimed softly.  Marrissa wiped her eyes with her sleeve
>and called out in a monotone, "Who is it?"

TOM: The Gate Keeper.

CROW: M.C. Hammer.

MIKE: Robert Ginty.

>        "Captain Picard," was the reply.

ALL: Oh.

>        "Come on in," Marrissa responded quickly.  Captain Picard
>entered the room.  Much to Marrissa's surprise, he wasn't wearing his
>uniform,

CROW: In fact, he wasn't wearing anything.

MIKE: You are on the verge of geting smacked, young man.

>	      instead he wore a simple gray outfit.  "Excuse the mess,
>Captain, but I have to pack up this stuff."
>        "Understood," the Captain replied.  "Have you eaten yet?"
>        "No, sir," Marrissa replied.
>        "Then perhaps you'd like to accompany me to Ten-Forward," I hear
>Guinan is serving fresh baked pizza today."

TOM: The Papa John's runabout came by.

>        "Aye, sir," Marrissa accepted.  The two walked out of Marrissa's
>quarters and down the hall.

CROW: Room 101.

>        "Did you enjoy your time in command?" Captain Picard enquired.

CROW: (Crypt Keeper laugh.)

>        "Aye, sir," Marrissa replied as they arrived at the turbolift.
>        "No complaints?" Picard asked as the turbolift doors opened.

MIKE (Marrissa): People didn't fear me enough.

>        "No sir," Marrissa replied as they entered the turbolift.
>        "Deck 10," Picard ordered.  "Surely you have some complaints."

TOM (Picard): Somebody had to have screwed up.

>        "I may not be staying on the Enterprise," Marrissa responded,
>"but I know better than to complain to the Captain about the padding on
>his command chair."
>        "You're not leaving," Picard stated.  "And I know about the
>padding."

CROW: This dialogue.

>        "I have to leave," Marrissa said sadly.  "My parents are gone.
>I have no one here any more."

TOM (crying): I've got nowhere else to go!

>        "You have me."
>        "You can't keep me.  Regulations..."

MIKE: No pets in the dorm.

>        "I don't know anything that forces you to leave your legal
>guardian," Picard answered. 

CROW: Child labor laws?

>				The turbolift opened on deck Ten.
>        "Do you know my guardian," Marrissa inquired.
>        "I've known him all my life," Captain Picard replied as they
>entered Ten-Forward.

TOM: Did Picard become Sybil all of a sudden?

>        "What's he like?" Marrissa asked.

MIKE (Picard): He's a real rightous bastard... Oh wait, that came out
wrong.

>        "He enjoys the Classics, in both literature and music," Picard
>described as they took a seat.

CROW (Marrissa): You mean, like, Iron Maden.

TOM (Picard): No.

>				  "He loves archeology and has a tactical
>maneuver named after him."

CROW: His name is John Missionary.

>        At that, Guinan interrupted them, "Before you get to the
>lionfish, would you and your companion like to

MIKE (Guinan): Get out of my bar.

>						       place an order,
>Jean-Luc."
>        "We'll have a medium pizza," he replied.  "Marrissa, what would
>you like on it?"

TOM (Marrissa): Strawberries.

>        "Turkey," Marrissa said,

ALL: TURKEY!

MIKE: Oh, they're putting this story on top of it.

>				   almost absentmindingly as she puzzled
>over the clues Captain Picard gave her.

CROW (Marrissa): Uh... Professor Plum, in the Library, with the
Candlestick.

>        "With Turkey on it," Picard confirmed.
>        As Guinan nodded and left, Marrissa suddenly put it all
>together.  "Are you my Guardian?" she asked, hopefully.
>        "Yes, I am," Captain Picard responded.  "In fact, if you want, I
>will even adopt you."

MIKE: Oh great.  Having Captain Droll as a father.  Woo-hoo.

>        Marrissa opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out.
>Captain Picard smiled.  He reached over the table and took her hand in
>his.  Then Guinan arrived with the hot steaming pizza. "One Turkey Pizza
>fresh from the oven," she said.  "Watch out it's hot."

TOM: And disgusting.

>
>        Across the room, Commander Riker  noticed Captain Picard and
>Marrissa eating pizza.  "I never thought I'd see him here on Pizza day,"
>he commented.

MIKE (Riker): Okay, we need a battle cry.  Something common, everyday,
and simplistic.  Something like, spoon. 

>        "I'm afraid I'm to blame," Counselor Troi said from beside him.
>        "Oh?" Riker asked.

CROW (Riker): I guess I'm just going to have to *spank* you.

TOM (Troi): Again?

>        "I suggested that if he was going to talk to Marrissa about
>adopting her, taking her out for pizza would be a good idea," Counselor
>Troi said.  
>        "You're not talking about our Captain Jean-Luc Picard are you,
>Deanna?" Will Riker said.

MIKE: No, she's talking about the other Jean-Luc Picard.  Of course
she's talking about him, you twit.

>			       "He practically runs out of the room when a
>child comes near.  When I came abroad he asked me to keep them away from
>him.  And I don't want to know the results of that field trip trick you
>played on him."

CROW: Hey, Mike.  I feel weird all of a sudden.

TOM: Yeah, me too.

>        "Will, the Captain has eased his discomfort around children
>considerably in the last couple of years," Deanna responded.  "In fact
>he enjoyed that archeology field trip with Marrissa's class."
>        "I don't believe it," Riker responded.
>        "Will, just look over there," Troi requested.  Marrissa and
>Captain Picard were talking over the pizza.  "Does that look like a man
>who is nervous around children?" 

CROW: Mike, I'm have a strange wave of sympathy for Marrissa wash over
me.

TOM: Is this normal.

MIKE: Guys, I think this place is starting to take effect on us.

>        Meanwhile, Captain Picard and Marrissa had just gotten to living
>arrangements. "I can have a room attached to my quarters, but it will
>take at least a week," Picard said.  
>        "And a bathroom," Marrissa insisted.
>        "We already have one," Picard said.
>        "You've never lived with girls have you?" Marrissa stated.
>        "No," Picard said.  "I just have one older brother."

TOM: Mike, it's starting to go beyond just sympathy.

CROW: I'm actually starting to *like* Marrissa, Mike.

MIKE: Guys, hold on.

>        "If you don't add the bathroom, you'll have to get ready for
>duty in your ready room," Marrissa said.
>        "Oh, then I'll add a bathroom to the plans," Captain Picard
>said.  "But we probably should be somewhere else when they work on it.
>How would you like to visit where I grew up in France?"
>        "I've never been to France before," Marrissa commented.

TOM: Come to think about it, Marrissa seems like an okay person.

CROW: She's more than just a person.

MIKE (quietly): Oh, no.

>
>        Gul Ducat in the Meantime was pacing in confinement.  'Someday
>they will have to let me out and when they do I will hunt down that
>little girl.  Marrissa Flores will wish she was never born.' he thought.
>'She will be crushed like the vole she is.'

CROW: Things are starting to make sense to me like they never have
before.

TOM: I have this uncontrolable urge to bow down and worship Marrissa.

>

>Epilogue
>
>        Marrissa laid stretched out in the back of the shuttlecraft.
>Captain Jean-Luc Picard looked at his newly adopted daughter.

MIKE (desperately): Come on guys, keep riffing!  Eh... I wonder why
Picard is looking at Marrissa like that?  Ha ha!

CROW: You dare to insinuate that Marrrissa would lay with one as lowly
as Picard!

TOM: You have blasphemed.

>								        Her long
>blond hair was arrayed around her head like a halo, and for once she
>seemed to be avoiding the bad dreams of the past week.  He hated to wake
>her, but they had almost reached their destination.
>        The countryside of France was below them.  The shuttle was
>awaiting clearance to descend to the landing level.  "Marrissa," he
>called out softly.  

CROW: The satellite has been polluted with your disrespect, Mike.

TOM: It must be purified.

>        Marrissa woke and sat up.  "What?" she asked as she put her hair
>back up in a pony tail.
>        "We're almost there," Picard said.  A light lit up on his
>console.  "We've just recieved clearance to land anywhere in Labarre.
>Any suggestions?"
>        "How about your brother's front door," Marrissa yawned.

MIKE: (Looking at them and nervous.)  Why are you looking at me like
that, guys? 

BOTS (low chanting): Marrissa. Marrissa. Marrissa...

>        "Still sleepy I see," her father responded.
>        "You were the one who gave me the helm for a couple of hours
>rest and ended up sleeping eight hours," Marrissa replied.  "I'm glad I
>have my pilots licence."

BOTS: Marrissa!  We hear and we obey!

>        "You were suppose to wake me up after a couple hours," Picard
>said.  
>        "Next time be a little more clear," Marrissa responded.
>
>        Captain Jean-Luc Picard spent the next month at the Picard
>Family Vineyards with his newly adopted daughter Marrissa Amber Picard.
>You'll hear about that in "All the King's Horses" coming soon.

BOTS: AAAAIIIIIEEEE!

MIKE (screaming): Guys!  What!

CROW: The great Marrissa is displeased!

TOM: We must abate her wrath.

CROW: With an offering of blood!

(The Bots knock Mike unconcious before he can respond and drag him from
the theater.)

0...2...3...4...5...6...*

(<SoL Bridge> Mike is tied up and gagged on the table.  Behind him is a
large statue in the likeness of Marrissa.  Torches are burning to either
side of him.  Crow and Tom and dancing around the table in a voodooistic
manner.)

CROW (chanting): Oh great Marrissa, goddess of entropy, we, your
faithful, have prepared a blood sacrifice out of this lowly one here. 
May our sacrifice please you, so that we can reign fear and conquer our
enemies, mightiest Marrissa.

(Crow withdraws a knife.)

TOM: Wait, I'm supposed to do the sacrifice.

CROW: No, I specifically remember Marrissa ordering me to do the
sacrifice.

TOM: She did not.  Hey, this was my idea.

CROW: Oh, yeah sure.  Well, who built the statue, huh?

TOM: Hey, listen pin-beak.  You hand over that sacrifical dagger right
now or you will eat it.

MIKE (gagged): Guys, this isn't funny.

BOTS: Shut up!

(Gypsy then walks in during Crow and Tom's bickering.)

GYPSY: Huh?  Oh my.  Hell has corrupted Crow and Tom to serve evil.  (To
Cambot.)  Now you listen up, Mr. Pinhead, you stop this right now.

(<Hell> Pinhead has strapped Dr. F. and Frank to devices that look like
what the Bots strapped Joel into during "Eeegah."  He hasn't noticed
Gypsy yet.  However, the box is sitting on a table just behind Pinhead.)

PINHEAD: Now, are you all ready for your Cynobyte transformation
process?

FRANK: Gee, I don't know about this.

PINHEAD: Oh, nonsense.  Everybody is doing it.  (Notices Gypsy.)  Oh,
terribly sorry, but I'm a little bit busy right now.  I'll call you
back.

(<SoL> Mike is thrashing to get out of his bonds, Crow and Tom are
fighting over the dagger, and Gypsy is up front.)

GYPSY: Oh, what am I going to do... Wait!  If I could get the box using
my half of the Umbillicus, I could get us all outta here.  But I need a
distraction.

(At that moment, a brilliant white light shines in front of Gypsy.)

GYPSY: Say.

(<Hell> Pinhead is just about to start the process when that white light
shines behind him.  He turns around and sees Torgo the White decending
from the air.)

TORGO: ReLEasE ThAT, ONe.  (He gestures to Frank.)  He iS UNdeR mY,
PRoTECtion.

PINHEAD: You!  I have a restraining order on you!

TORGO: REleASE, Him, or SUFfer my, WRaTH.

(Torgo raises his arms, and the angelic forms of Princess Di and John
Denver appear in a soft glow behind him, ready to fight.)

JOHN (singing): You fill up my senses, with feelings of darkness.

PINHEAD: Ha!

(Pinhead snaps his fingers and in a puff of smoke the forms of OJ
Simpson and Louise Woodward appear behind him.)

OJ: Wait a minute, we're not dead yet.

LOUISE (bawling): Yeah!  *soobbbbb*
 
PINHEAD: You two owe me.  (To Torgo.)  Now, prepare yourselves.

TORGO: TheRE cAN be, OnlY ONE.

(They start fighting Mortal Kombat style.  Up on the Satellite, Gypsy
realizes that this is the opportunity that she has been waiting for, and
we see a shot of the Umbilicus tube crawling down and slowly inching out
towards the box.  Pinhead, during the fight, suddenly realizes what's
happening and makes a dash for the box.  He is tripped by John Denver's
guitar and Gypsy grabs the box and sucks it.  We see the glowing light
of box being sucked up the tube and pop out of her mouth.  She then,
somehow, begins to push the box back into place with her nose.)

<Hell>

PINHEAD: Don't you do that!

<SoL>

GYPSY: You go to, oh, you're already there.

(The box is back in its original place.  Pinhead and all the other
greater beings disappear.  The devices that Dr. F and Frank were
strapped to disappear.  The Dark Room becomes Deep 13 again.)

<Deep 13>

DR. F: Thank you, uh, Gypsy.  I suppose as a token of gratitude, I'll
put off showing you guys "Samson Versus the Vampire Women" until next
week. 

(<SoL> It's back to normal and Mike has just finished untying himself
and Gypsy has just spat the box into deep space.)

MIKE: Yeah, whatever.  You guys, this wasn't funny.  I almost believed
that you were going to kill me back then.

CROW: Yeah, well, I think we were.

TOM: Yeah, I'm sorry Mike.  But with that story and our surroundings, I
just caved in to the temptation.  I feel really bad.

CROW: Yeah, me too buddy.

MIKE: Yeah, well forget it.  I'm not talking to you guys anymore.  (He
turns his back to them.)

CROW: Oh, come on Mike.  Hey, how are we going to get through those
future experiments without your help.  We're a team.  Come on.  Whadda
ya say.  (He holds out his hand.)  Partners?

TOM: (His arm somehow extends out to clasp Crow's hand.)  Partners.

(Mike reluctantly turns around reluctantly and extends his arm into the
middle as well.  Ho, by the way.  The camera angles for this are same as
in Batman and Robin, and the music started up with Crow's speech.)

MIKE: Partners.

GYPSY: I think we're going to need a bigger satellite.

(The view is now down the SoL tunnel with all the doors open.  It's
rather dark, except for one bright light down at the end of it. 
Suddenly, out from the sides, we see the silhouettes of Mike, Crow and
Tom around the corners and start running towards us.  Well, Tom is
hovering really quickly towards us.  Oddly enough, we can see that
they're all wearing those huge, rubbery Barman and Robin costumes. 
Considering how hard it would be for the puppeteers to do this scene,
it's all computer animated, eating up a huge portion of the budget. 
They run towards Cambot, and instead of running around and over him,
they collide right with him, killing the picture and the music.  There
is only the dark screen now.)

CROW (v.o.): Sorry, my fault.

MIKE (v.o.): Crow!

End.
